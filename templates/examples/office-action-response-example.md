## IDENTIFICATION OF AMENDMENTS

In response to the rejections set forth in the Office Action, claims **1, 3, and 7** have been amended. A clean set of claims is provided in the _Claims_ section, and a marked-up version is provided below with additions **underlined** and deletions <del>struck-through</del> in brackets.

### Amended Claim 1 (marked-up)

1. A tandem solar cell comprising:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a silicon bottom sub-cell; and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) a perovskite top sub-cell _comprising a mixed-cation perovskite layer having a bandgap of **1.75 ± 0.05 eV**_;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <del>[an interconnection layer]</del> **a recombination layer comprising transparent conductive oxide and alkali-metal passivation additives** disposed between the silicon bottom sub-cell and the perovskite top sub-cell; and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) electrical contacts configured to extract current from the tandem solar cell.

## REMARKS AND ARGUMENTS

### Rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103 — _Wang et al._ (US 10/456,789) in view of _Garcia et al._ (US 2019/0123456)

The Examiner contends that Wang teaches a perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell and that Garcia renders obvious the use of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) interconnection layer. The Examiner further asserts that it would have been obvious to include alkali-metal additives to improve passivation.

Applicant respectfully submits that the combination of Wang and Garcia fails to render amended independent Claim 1 obvious for at least the following reasons:

1. **Bandgap Limitation Not Taught or Suggested.**  
   • Wang discloses a perovskite bandgap of **1.60 eV** (col. 5, lns. 12-20), optimized for indoor-lighting conditions.  
   • Garcia is silent regarding perovskite bandgap.  
   • Neither reference teaches or suggests a bandgap of **1.75 ± 0.05 eV**, which Applicant has found critical for current matching with the silicon sub-cell (see Specification, ¶ [0042]).

2. **Recombination Layer Composition Differentiates Over the Art.**  
   • Garcia discloses an ITO layer without passivation additives (¶ [0035]).  
   • Amended Claim 1 now recites “a recombination layer comprising transparent conductive oxide **and alkali-metal passivation additives**.”  
   • The Examiner’s rationale that alkali-metal additives are “well-known to improve performance” lacks an articulated reason with rational underpinning as required by _KSR v. Teleflex_, 550 U.S. 398 (2007). Neither reference recognizes or suggests that incorporating alkali-metal ions **within** the TCO layer unexpectedly reduces interface recombination velocity by >30 %, as demonstrated in Experimental Results, Fig. 6 of the instant application.

3. **Teaching Away.**  
   • Wang expressly warns that alkali metals “deteriorate perovskite layer stability” (col. 7, lns. 5-9), thereby teaching away from their inclusion in proximity to the perovskite sub-cell.  
   • A person of ordinary skill would therefore be dissuaded from introducing such additives contrary to the Examiner’s combination.

4. **Unexpected Results.**  
   • As evidenced by the Declaration of Dr. Lin (attached), integration of alkali-metal passivation within the TCO layer yields an **8 % absolute increase** in power-conversion efficiency and improves thermal stability at 85 °C for 1,000 h. These results are unexpected relative to Wang and Garcia, which individually report no more than 2 % incremental gains.

Accordingly, the combination of Wang and Garcia does not teach nor render obvious the amended limitations of Claim 1, and the § 103 rejection should be withdrawn.

### Dependent Claims

Claims 3 and 7 have been amended to depend from and incorporate the limitations of amended Claim 1. The Examiner’s objections to these claims are thus moot.

---

## CONCLUSION

Applicant respectfully traverses the rejections and submits that the present amendments and arguments place the application in condition for allowance. Prompt reconsideration and issuance of a Notice of Allowance are respectfully requested. Should the Examiner believe that an interview would expedite prosecution, the undersigned is available at the Examiner’s convenience.
