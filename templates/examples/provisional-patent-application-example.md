## TECHNICAL FIELD

[0001] The present disclosure relates generally to controlled-environment agriculture and, more particularly, to autonomous hydroponic cultivation systems incorporating Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor networks and adaptive nutrient delivery algorithms.

---

## BACKGROUND

[0002] Modern urban agriculture faces challenges including limited arable land, fluctuating climatic conditions, and inconsistent crop yields. Conventional hydroponic systems require frequent manual calibration of pH, nutrient concentration, and photoperiod parameters. Such manual intervention introduces human error, increases labor costs, and hampers scalability. Existing automated solutions typically apply static nutrient schedules that fail to account for rapid changes in plant physiology and environmental variables, leading to sub-optimal growth and resource inefficiency.

---

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The disclosed smart modular hydroponic cultivation system continuously monitors key growth variables—such as dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, nutrient ion balance, ambient CO₂, and leaf transpiration rate—through a distributed array of low-power IoT sensors. A cloud-hosted analytics engine executes a machine-learning model trained on varietal growth curves and environmental data to determine optimal nutrient compositions and irrigation intervals in real time. Nutrient solution is dispensed via a multi-channel peristaltic pump manifold equipped with inline optical flow meters, ensuring dosage accuracy to within ±1 %. The modular design allows individual growth trays to be added or removed without interrupting system operation, facilitating scalable deployment from countertop units to commercial vertical farms.

[0004] In certain embodiments, predictive control logic pre-emptively adjusts photoperiod and spectrum based on forecasted stress conditions, thereby reducing energy expenditure while maintaining target biomass accumulation. Integration with a mobile application provides agronomists with actionable insights, remote override functionality, and tamper-evident audit logs.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0006] **System Architecture.** Referring to FIG. 1, the cultivation system 100 comprises a plurality of rectangular growth trays 102a-102n stacked vertically within a rigid aluminum frame 104. Each tray includes an integrated root chamber 106 with recirculating nutrient solution and an overhead LED lighting panel 108 capable of emitting wavelengths between 400 nm and 740 nm.

[0007] **Sensor Suite.** As shown in FIG. 2, each tray houses: (i) a dissolved oxygen sensor 110; (ii) a pH/EC combo probe 112; (iii) a multispectral leaf imagers 114; and (iv) a thermohygrometer 116. Sensors communicate over an RS-485 bus to a microcontroller unit (MCU) 120 that aggregates data at 10-second intervals.

[0008] **Control Algorithm.** FIG. 3 depicts an adaptive nutrient delivery routine executed by a cloud service. Raw sensor data is normalized and fed into a gradient-boosted regression model producing target nutrient profiles. The MCU actuates peristaltic pumps 130a-130d to dispense micro-doses of concentrated nutrient solutions A–D into a mixing reservoir 132. Optical flow meters 134 verify volumetric accuracy before aqueous solution returns to trays via gravity feed.

[0009] **Modularity.** Each tray includes a hot-swappable quick-connect interface 140 carrying power and data, enabling expansion or maintenance without halting cultivation. Firmware auto-discovers newly attached trays and updates the digital twin accordingly.

[0010] **Exemplary Operation.** During lettuce growth (Lactuca sativa), the system maintains electrical conductivity between 1.2-1.6 mS/cm, pH 5.8-6.2, and a 16/8 light cycle at 200 µmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹. Deviation beyond ±5 % triggers corrective nutrient dosing or light adjustment within 60 seconds.

[0011] **Alternative Embodiments.** In other embodiments, the sensor suite may include a chlorophyll fluorescence probe to estimate photosynthetic efficiency, or a dissolved CO₂ module for aquatic plant species. The control algorithm may be implemented on-premises using an edge-compute node in low-connectivity environments.

## ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION

[0007] The present invention provides several technical advantages over existing solutions:

1. **Dynamic Nutrient Profiling:** Real-time adjustment improves yield by up to 25 % compared with static dosing schedules.
2. **Modular Scalability:** Hot-swappable trays enable incremental expansion without downtime.
3. **Resource Efficiency:** Predictive lighting control reduces energy consumption by approximately 18 %.
4. **Reduced Labor:** Autonomous calibration minimizes manual intervention to routine reservoir refills.
5. **Data-Driven Agronomy:** Continuous data logging facilitates cultivar-specific optimization and traceability.
