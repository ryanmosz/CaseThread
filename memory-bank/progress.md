3. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Blob URL Issue:**
   - Updated HTML meta tag CSP to include `connect-src 'self' blob:`
   - Fixed PDF.js being blocked from loading blob URLs
   - Added `unsafe-eval` to script-src (required by PDF.js)

4. **PDF Export Functionality Fixed:**
   - Updated usePDFExport hook to pass correct PDFExportRequest structure
   - Added requestId, documentType, and proper buffer type (Uint8Array)
   - Fixed export button to detect and pass document type
   - Added silent export method for programmatic saves
   - Export to filesystem now fully functional

### What's Working Now:
- ✅ Meeting memo auto-loads from `output/2023-05-24-meeting-memo.md`
- ✅ Generate PDF button creates 10-page PDF
- ✅ View automatically switches to PDF mode after generation
- ✅ PDF displays correctly with zoom, rotation, page navigation
- ✅ Export PDF button saves to filesystem with save dialog
- ✅ Toast notifications for success/error states
- ✅ PDF metadata panel shows document info
- ✅ Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+S) for export

### Backend Services (CLI):
✅ Multi-agent workflow operational
✅ OpenAI integration for content enhancement
✅ Template system with all 8 document types
✅ YAML form data input
✅ PDF generation to file
✅ Quality pipeline with Overseer review

### Testing Infrastructure:
✅ Automated test scripts for PDF functionality
✅ Process management prevents multiple instances
✅ Comprehensive logging and error detection

## What's Not Yet Implemented

- Progress Integration (6.0.5) - Real-time progress updates in UI
- State Management (6.0.6) - Advanced PDF state handling
- Error Handling (6.0.7) - Comprehensive error recovery
- Testing (6.0.8) - Unit and integration tests for PDF features
- Documentation (6.0.9) - User guides and API docs

### Nice-to-have Features:

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **PDF Generation Architecture**: Buffer-based for GUI, file-based for CLI
2. **IPC Security**: Request validation and rate limiting
3. **Memory Management**: Blob URL cleanup and buffer limits
4. **Progress Reporting**: Event-based with request tracking
5. **Export Options**: Interactive (with dialog) and silent modes
