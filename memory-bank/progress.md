# Progress Tracking

## Current Status (December 13, 2024)

### Active Work: Task 6.0 - GUI Integration with PDF Service

**Progress: 18/33 subtasks complete (55%)**

#### Sections Complete:
- ✅ 6.0.1 Design and Planning (4/4)
- ✅ 6.0.2 IPC Infrastructure (4/4) 
- ✅ 6.0.3 UI Components (4/4)
- ✅ 6.0.4 PDF Display Implementation (4/4)

#### In Progress:
- 6.0.5 Progress Integration (0/3)
- 6.0.6 State Management (0/3)
- 6.0.7 Error Handling (0/3)
- 6.0.8 Testing (0/4)
- 6.0.9 Documentation and Cleanup (0/3)

### Recent Fixes Applied:

1. **PDF.js Worker Loading Issue:**
   - Fixed worker configuration for react-pdf v7
   - Created public directory and copied worker file
   - Updated vite config with publicDir setting
   - Used proper import.meta.url approach

2. **TypeScript Compilation Error:**
   - Fixed keywords field handling in PDFServiceFactory (string not array)
   - Fixed metadata property access in LegalPDFGenerator to use nested structure

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP) Error:**
   - Fixed CSP in Electron main process to allow blob URLs
   - **Final Fix**: Updated HTML meta tag CSP to include:
     - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'` (for PDF.js)
     - `img-src 'self' data: https: blob:` (for blob images)
     - `connect-src 'self' blob:` (for blob URL connections)
   - The HTML meta tag was overriding the header CSP set in main process

### Key Technical Details:
- PDF generation produces 26KB file with 10 pages
- Blob URLs are created successfully and passed to PDFViewer
- CSP must be configured in both main process headers AND HTML meta tags
- PDF.js requires 'unsafe-eval' for script-src due to its internal workings

### Known Issues:
- PDF.js worker configuration in Electron requires careful setup
- TypeScript errors in backend prevent CLI from running

### Current Functionality:
- PDF generation working (creates 10-page PDF from meeting memo)
- PDF buffer created successfully
- Blob URL created properly
- View mode switches to PDF
- Toast notifications working
- PDF metadata display working

### Remaining Issues:
- Need to verify PDF actually displays after worker fix
- Complete progress integration tasks
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Write tests for all components

## What Works

### CLI Application
- Full CLI workflow operational
- All 8 document types generating correctly
- Quality pipeline with AI agents
- Template system with formatting rules

### GUI Application (Electron)
- Document viewer with editing capabilities
- Meeting memo auto-loads
- IPC communication established
- PDF generation infrastructure complete
- Basic UI components in place

### PDF Service
- Modular architecture with clean separation
- Buffer-based generation for GUI
- Progress reporting system
- Comprehensive formatting engine
- Signature block parsing

## What Needs to Be Built

### GUI PDF Integration (Task 6.0)
1. Complete progress integration with BackgroundGenerationStatus
2. Implement state management for PDF data
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Write tests for all new components
5. Update documentation

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-document management
- PDF annotation features
- Export to different formats
- Print functionality
- Search within PDFs
