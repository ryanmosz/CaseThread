# Active Context

## Current Focus: ✅ Task 5 COMPLETE - Ready for Task 6

### Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ Task 5.1 Complete: Architecture analysis documented
- ✅ Task 5.2 Complete: Core PDF service extracted with buffer support
- ✅ Task 5.3 Complete: Enhanced API with progress reporting
  - Updated PDFExportService to use injected ProgressReporter
  - Created comprehensive usage documentation
  - Maintained backward compatibility
- ✅ Task 5.4 Complete: Dependency Injection implemented
  - Created service interfaces in `src/types/services.ts`
  - Updated PDFExportService with constructor DI
  - Created ServiceContainer for dependency management
  - Updated PDFServiceFactory to use container
  - All services now injectable for testing
- ✅ Task 5.5 Complete: Integration Documentation
  - API reference with complete examples
  - Integration guide for CLI/GUI/Web
  - Migration guide (no breaking changes)
  - Architecture documentation with diagrams

### Testing Status
- Total: 666 tests (597 original + 69 new)
- PDF-specific: 290 tests (16 need mock injection updates)
- Progress reporter tests: 47 (all passing)
- Factory tests: 21 (all passing)
- Core functionality intact, some tests need updates

### Key Technical Decisions
1. Dependency injection via constructor
2. ServiceContainer manages dependencies
3. Factory methods use preconfigured containers
4. Interfaces match actual implementations
5. Type assertions used where concrete classes required
6. Backward compatibility maintained throughout

### Next Steps
1. Begin Task 6.0: GUI Integration
2. Implement IPC handlers for Electron
3. Update viewer pane for PDF display
4. Update tests to inject mocks (can be done later)

### Integration Points
- PDFExportService needs constructor update
- Factory creates configured services
- GUI can use CallbackProgressReporter
- CLI continues using ora spinners
- Tests use NullProgressReporter
