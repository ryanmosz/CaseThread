# CaseThread Electron GUI - Project Brief

## Project Overview
CaseThread is a sophisticated CLI-based legal document generation system that uses multi-agent AI architecture to create IP legal documents. This project aims to add an Electron-based GUI to provide a modern, user-friendly interface for attorneys to generate legal documents.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal
Transform the existing CLI-based document generation workflow into an intuitive desktop application that maintains the sophisticated multi-agent architecture while providing a visual interface.

### Key Features
1. **Three-Pane Interface Design**
   - Left Pane: Document browser (static mock-data folder view)
   - Middle Pane: Document viewer/generator display
   - Right Pane: IP Document Template selector

2. **Template-Based Document Generation**
   - Visual selection from 8 core IP document templates
   - Form modal for template field input
   - Real-time document generation and preview

3. **Integration with Existing System**
   - Maintain existing CLI generate functionality
   - Preserve multi-agent architecture (Context Builder, Drafting, Overseer)
   - Keep vector search and ChromaDB integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] User can browse documents visually in left pane
- [ ] User can select from IP document templates in right pane
- [ ] Form modal captures all required template fields
- [ ] Generate button successfully calls existing CLI functionality
- [ ] Generated documents display in middle viewer pane
- [ ] Application maintains performance of existing system

## Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing TypeScript codebase
- Preserve existing Docker deployment capability
- Maintain OpenAI integration and vector search functionality
- Keep existing template system intact

## Target Users
- IP attorneys using CaseThread for document generation
- Legal professionals who prefer GUI over CLI interfaces
- Law firms wanting desktop application deployment
