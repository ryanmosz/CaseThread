# CaseThread GUI - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
The current CaseThread CLI interface, while powerful, creates barriers for attorneys who:
- Prefer visual interfaces over command-line tools
- Need quick document browsing capabilities
- Want intuitive template selection workflows
- Require immediate visual feedback during document generation

### Solution Vision
A desktop GUI application that transforms the sophisticated CLI workflow into an intuitive three-pane interface, making legal document generation accessible to all attorneys regardless of technical comfort level.

## How It Should Work

### User Journey
1. **Document Discovery**: Attorney opens application and browses existing documents in left pane
2. **Template Selection**: Attorney selects appropriate IP document template from right pane list
3. **Form Completion**: Modal form opens with template-specific fields for data input
4. **Document Generation**: Generate button triggers existing CLI functionality
5. **Review & Export**: Generated document appears in middle viewer for review

### Core User Experience Principles
- **Familiar Layout**: Three-pane design mirrors common legal software interfaces
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear template categorization and field organization
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time form validation and generation status
- **Contextual Help**: Template explanations and field guidance

## Document Templates Integration

### Available Templates (8 Core IP Documents)
1. **Patent Documents**
   - Provisional Patent Application
   - Patent Assignment Agreement
   - Patent License Agreement
   - Office Action Response

2. **Trademark Documents**
   - Trademark Application

3. **Business Documents**
   - NDA (IP-Specific)
   - Technology Transfer Agreement
   - Cease and Desist Letter

### Template Field System
Each template contains structured fields from `/templates/core/*.json`:
- Required fields (must be completed before generation)
- Optional fields (enhance document quality)
- Field validation rules
- Help text and examples

## Integration Requirements

### Backend Preservation
- Maintain existing multi-agent architecture
- Preserve vector search functionality
- Keep ChromaDB integration intact
- Ensure Docker deployment compatibility

### Data Flow
```
GUI Form → Template Fields → CLI Generate Command → Multi-Agent Processing → Document Output → GUI Viewer
```

## Success Metrics
- Reduced time from template selection to document generation
- Increased attorney adoption over CLI interface
- Maintained document quality and accuracy
- Preserved system performance and reliability
