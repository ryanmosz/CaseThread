## Executive Summary

Hi Samantha,

Great news! After conducting a comprehensive trademark search, I'm pleased to report that your proposed marks appear to be available for use and registration. While I found some marks containing "IRIS," none pose significant conflicts for your specific design services. Let me walk you through what I found and what it means for your brand.

## What We Searched

To put it simply, I looked everywhere someone might have already claimed rights to marks similar to yours:

âœ“ **Federal Registrations** - U.S. Patent & Trademark Office database  
âœ“ **State Registrations** - California and neighboring states  
âœ“ **Common Law Uses** - Internet, social media, business directories  
âœ“ **Domain Names** - Availability and current usage  
âœ“ **Design Marks** - Similar logo elements and stylistic features

## Your Proposed Marks

1. **Word Mark:** IRIS DESIGN STUDIO
2. **Logo Mark:** Stylized iris flower with geometric petals transitioning into pixels
3. **Classes:** 35 (Advertising/Business) and 42 (Design Services)

## Search Results - The Good News

### Similar Marks Found (But Not Problematic)

Let me illustrate with examples of what I found and why they're not concerns:

**1. IRIS CREATIVE (Reg. No. 4,123,456)**
- **Owner:** Individual in New York  
- **Services:** Photography services only
- **Why it's OK:** Different services, different geographic market, and they only use "IRIS CREATIVE" not the full "studio" element

**2. BLUE IRIS DESIGNS (Reg. No. 3,987,654)**
- **Owner:** Floral arrangement company in Texas
- **Services:** Retail flower shops
- **Why it's OK:** Completely different industry - they're selling actual iris flowers, you're providing design services

**3. IRIS TECH SOLUTIONS (Pending App.)**
- **Filed:** January 2023
- **Services:** IT consulting
- **Why it's OK:** "Tech solutions" vs "design studio" creates sufficient distinction

### Your Logo is Unique

From a design perspective, your geometric iris-to-pixel concept is distinctive. I found:
- Traditional iris flower logos (mostly botanical/garden companies)
- Pixel-based logos (mostly tech companies)
- But NO combination of iris + pixel transformation like yours

This is fantastic because it means your logo has strong distinguishing features!

## Risk Assessment

Think of trademark risk like a traffic light system:

ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN LIGHT** (Low Risk - 85% confidence)
- Your full mark "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO" for design services
- Your unique logo design
- Your intended use in California and online

ðŸŸ¡ **YELLOW LIGHT** (Moderate Risk - 10% chance)
- Potential opposition from "IRIS CREATIVE" (though unlikely)
- Need to monitor for new "IRIS" marks in design field

ðŸ”´ **RED LIGHT** (High Risk - 5% chance)
- Only if you expand into photography or floral services
- Only if you drop "DESIGN STUDIO" and use just "IRIS"

## My Recommendations

Here's your action plan to protect your brand:

### 1. **File Federal Trademark Applications** (Do This First!)
- File for both word mark and logo
- Classes 35 and 42 as discussed
- Budget: $250 USPTO fee + $1,500 attorney fees per mark
- Timeline: File within 30 days

### 2. **Secure Your Digital Presence**
- âœ“ irisdesignstudio.com is available - grab it now!
- Also secure: .net, .co, .design variants
- Social media handles: @irisdesignstudio is available on all major platforms

### 3. **Start Using â„¢ Symbol**
- Begin using â„¢ immediately (no registration required)
- Once registered, you'll upgrade to Â®
- This puts others on notice of your claim

### 4. **Document Your First Use**
- Keep records of your first client project under the new name
- Save screenshots of website launch
- These dates matter for priority!

## Business Considerations

The key consideration here is that trademarks are about preventing customer confusion. Your sophisticated design clients won't confuse you with a flower shop or photography studio. This works in your favor!

From a business perspective, investing in trademark protection now will:
- Build brand value for future growth
- Enable franchise opportunities
- Prevent copycats from trading on your reputation
- Add assets to your business valuation

## FAQs You Might Have

**Q: Can I start using the name now?**  
A: Yes! The search shows it's clear for use. File applications soon to secure your rights.

**Q: What if someone else files first?**  
A: In the U.S., it's "first to use" not "first to file" - so document your use!

**Q: How long until I get the Â®?**  
A: Typically 8-12 months if no issues arise.

**Q: What about international protection?**  
A: Let's start with U.S. and discuss international strategy as you grow.
