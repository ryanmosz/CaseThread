Re: **Notice of Opposition - "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO" - Application Serial No. 97/123,456**  
    **Our Client: Iris Creative Group, Inc.**

Dear Mr. Rodriguez:

We represent Iris Creative Group, Inc. ("ICG"), a New York corporation that has been providing premium branding and design services since 2018. We write concerning your client's pending trademark application for "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO" (Application Serial No. 97/123,456, filed March 22, 2023).

**Prior Rights**

Our client owns the following federal trademark registration:

- **IRIS CREATIVE** - Reg. No. 4,123,456
- Registered: June 15, 2019
- Classes: 35, 42
- Services: "Graphic design services; brand identity design; logo design; advertising design services"

Additionally, ICG has been using IRIS CREATIVE continuously since January 2018 in connection with design services throughout the United States, including significant business activities in California.

**Likelihood of Confusion**

We believe your client's proposed mark IRIS DESIGN STUDIO is confusingly similar to our client's registered IRIS CREATIVE mark. Both marks:

1. Share the dominant element "IRIS" for identical/closely related services
2. Target the same consumer base (businesses seeking design services)  
3. Operate in overlapping trade channels (online and Bay Area markets)
4. Create similar commercial impressions

The addition of the merely descriptive terms "DESIGN STUDIO" does not sufficiently distinguish the marks. Relevant TTAB decisions consistently hold that adding generic/descriptive terms to an existing mark does not avoid likelihood of confusion. See *In re Integrated Embedded*, 120 USPQ2d 1504 (TTAB 2016).

**Evidence of Actual Confusion**

We have already documented instances of actual confusion:

- Three prospective clients contacted ICG asking if we had opened a "studio division" in California
- Social media posts tagging @iriscreative when referring to your client's services
- A vendor invoice mistakenly sent to ICG intended for your client

**Demand**

In light of the foregoing, we respectfully demand that your client:

1. **Abandon** the pending application for IRIS DESIGN STUDIO
2. **Cease all use** of any marks containing IRIS for design-related services
3. **Confirm in writing** within thirty (30) days that these actions have been taken

**Proposed Resolution**

Our client prefers to resolve this matter amicably. ICG would consider:

- Allowing use of a substantially different mark that does not contain IRIS
- A phased transition period of 90 days for rebranding
- No monetary demands if resolved cooperatively

However, if necessary, ICG is prepared to:
- File a formal opposition with the USPTO
- Pursue cancellation of any registration that may issue
- Seek injunctive relief and damages in federal court

**Response Required**

Please respond by **June 15, 2023**. We remain hopeful that this matter can be resolved without formal proceedings. Our client has invested significantly in the IRIS CREATIVE brand and must protect its valuable trademark rights.

Should you wish to discuss this matter, please contact the undersigned at jhamilton@hamiltonip.com or (415) 555-9001.

Sincerely,

**/s/ Jonathan Hamilton**
