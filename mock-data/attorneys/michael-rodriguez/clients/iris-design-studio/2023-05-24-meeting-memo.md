## Meeting Purpose

Discuss response strategy to Iris Creative Group's opposition threat regarding client's IRIS DESIGN STUDIO trademark application.

## Key Points from Client

### Business Background
- Samantha founded Iris Design Studio in 2015 (8 years of use)
- Named after her grandmother Iris, who was also an artist
- Strong emotional attachment to the name
- 80% of business is Bay Area local, 20% remote clients
- No current plans to expand to East Coast
- Recently invested $15K in rebranding/website with current name

### Client's Concerns
1. Cost of potential litigation
2. Impact on current clients if forced to rebrand
3. Time away from business for legal proceedings
4. Reputation concerns in design community

### Client's Goals
- Keep using IRIS DESIGN STUDIO if possible
- Minimize legal costs
- Resolve quickly to focus on business
- Maintain professional reputation

## Strategic Analysis

### Strength Assessment
**Our Position: MODERATE TO STRONG**

Positive factors:
- 8 years of use (predates their registration)
- Geographic separation (West vs East Coast)
- Additional distinguishing elements ("DESIGN STUDIO")
- Personal story/connection to name
- Unique logo design adds distinction
- Local reputation and goodwill

Challenges:
- They have federal registration
- Some evidence of confusion
- Same industry (design services)
- "IRIS" is dominant element in both marks

### Risk Analysis
- **Opposition proceeding:** 65% chance they file if we don't respond favorably
- **Likelihood of success if opposed:** 50-60% in our favor
- **Estimated costs if opposed:** $8,000-15,000
- **Time to resolution:** 12-18 months if contested

## Agreed Strategy

After discussing all options, Samantha has decided to pursue a **"Negotiate First, Fight if Necessary"** approach:

### Phase 1: Negotiation (Next 30 days)
1. Respond professionally but firmly to Hamilton & Associates
2. Emphasize our prior use and geographic distinction
3. Propose coexistence agreement with:
   - Geographic limitations (them: East Coast, us: West Coast)
   - Different marketing channels
   - Distinct visual presentation requirements
   - No expansion into each other's core markets

### Phase 2: Modified Backup Plan
If negotiation fails, Samantha is willing to consider:
- Adding geographic identifier: "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO SF" or "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO WEST"
- Emphasizing logo in all uses
- Accepting some limitations on national expansion

### Phase 3: Defend if Necessary
If they insist on complete abandonment:
- File response to opposition
- Argue prior use, distinctiveness, no likelihood of confusion
- Budget cap at $12,000 for proceedings

## Action Items

### Immediate (By 5/26/23):
1. **MR:** Draft response letter to Hamilton & Associates
2. **SL:** Gather evidence of use since 2015
3. **SL:** Compile client testimonials mentioning business name

### Next Week (By 5/31/23):
1. **MR:** Send response letter after client approval
2. **SL:** Create timeline of business milestones
3. **MR:** Research similar coexistence agreements

### Contingency Planning:
1. **MR:** Prepare opposition response outline (just in case)
2. **SL:** Soft-test "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO SF" with trusted clients
3. **MR:** Get litigation budget approval in writing

## Client Guidance Provided

Advised client to:
- Continue normal business operations
- Document all uses of the mark
- Keep any instances of actual confusion (their side or ours)
- Not discuss matter on social media
- Refer any direct contact from ICG to attorney

## Billing Notes

Meeting time: 1.5 hours @ $450/hour = $675
Prep time: 0.5 hours @ $450/hour = $225
Follow-up tasks estimated: 3-4 hours

## Personal Notes

Samantha is understandably emotional about potentially losing her grandmother's name. This adds complexity but also strengthens our "personal name" argument. She's practical about business needs but wants to fight for the name if there's reasonable chance of success. Good client - responsive and organized.

Consider mentioning the personal story in response letter - could humanize our position and encourage settlement.
