**CLIENT ADVISORY LETTER**

**TO:** Samantha Lee, Iris Design Studio  
**FROM:** Michael Rodriguez  
**DATE:** May 18, 2023  
**RE:** Trademark Opposition from Iris Creative Group - Let's Talk Strategy  
**MATTER NO:** IDS-2023-002

---

## Hi Samantha,

I wanted to reach out immediately about a development with your trademark application. We received a letter from an attorney representing "Iris Creative Group" in New York. They're challenging your IRIS DESIGN STUDIO trademark application.

**First things first: Don't panic.** This kind of thing happens more often than you'd think, especially with common words like "Iris." Let me break down what's happening and, more importantly, how we can handle this.

## What They're Claiming

A company called Iris Creative Group (ICG) says they have prior rights to use "IRIS" for design services because:

- They registered "IRIS CREATIVE" in 2019
- They claim they've been using it since 2018
- They think customers will be confused between the two names
- They want us to abandon your trademark and stop using IRIS entirely

## The Reality Check üéØ

Here's my honest assessment after reviewing their letter:

### Their Strengths:
- ‚úì They do have a registered trademark
- ‚úì They're in the same general industry (design services)
- ‚úì They documented some instances of confusion

### Our Strengths:
- ‚úì "IRIS" is a common word (flower, eye part, goddess)
- ‚úì Your full name is more distinctive: "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO" vs "IRIS CREATIVE"
- ‚úì Different geographic markets (you're local Bay Area, they're NYC)
- ‚úì Your unique logo adds distinction
- ‚úì You have actual clients who know you specifically

## What This Means for Your Business

**Can you keep operating?** YES! Their letter is just that - a letter. You haven't been sued, and there's no court order. Keep running your business as normal.

**Will this delay your trademark?** Possibly. If they file a formal opposition, it could add 12-18 months to the process. But that doesn't mean they'll win.

**Could this get expensive?** I'll be straight with you - if they file formal proceedings, costs could range from $5,000-15,000. But there are strategies to minimize this.

## Your Options (From Least to Most Aggressive)

### Option 1: The Rebrand üîÑ
- **What:** Pick a new name without "Iris"
- **Pros:** Cheapest, fastest, no legal battle
- **Cons:** Lose brand recognition you've built
- **My take:** Only consider if you're not attached to the name

### Option 2: The Modification üé®
- **What:** Adjust to something like "Iris Bay Design" or "Studio Iris SF"
- **Pros:** Keep some brand equity, likely avoid conflict
- **Cons:** Still requires some rebranding
- **My take:** Good compromise if you're flexible

### Option 3: The Negotiation ü§ù
- **What:** Work out a coexistence agreement
- **Pros:** Both keep using versions of IRIS with specific limitations
- **Cons:** Some restrictions on expansion
- **My take:** Often the smartest business move

### Option 4: The Fight ü•ä
- **What:** Defend your right to use IRIS DESIGN STUDIO
- **Pros:** Keep your exact name if we win
- **Cons:** Most expensive and time-consuming
- **My take:** Viable, but let's explore other options first

## My Recommendation

Based on what I know about your business and growth plans, I think we should start with **Option 3 (Negotiation)** while being prepared for **Option 4 (Fight)** if needed. Here's why:

1. Their attorney left the door open for "amicable resolution"
2. You have legitimate arguments about distinctiveness
3. The markets don't overlap much (yet)
4. A coexistence agreement could work for both parties

## Next Steps - Let's Meet!

I'd like to discuss this with you in person. Can you come to my office next week? We'll need about an hour to:

- Review your business expansion plans
- Discuss your attachment to the current name
- Look at potential modifications if needed
- Plan our response strategy

**Available times:**
- Tuesday 5/23 at 2:00 PM
- Wednesday 5/24 at 10:00 AM  
- Thursday 5/25 at 3:00 PM

## What to Bring to Our Meeting

- Any examples of your established brand use
- Client testimonials mentioning your name
- Your 5-year business plan
- Ideas for alternative names (just in case)
- Questions - write them all down!

## Don't Worry - We've Got This!

Samantha, I know this feels overwhelming, but remember - you're not the first designer to face this, and you won't be the last. The fact that they're in New York and you're here actually works in our favor. Most of these disputes end in reasonable agreements where both parties can coexist.

The key consideration here is what makes the most business sense for you. Sometimes fighting on principle costs more than it's worth. Other times, your brand is worth protecting at any cost. Let's figure out which situation we're in.

Call me if you're losing sleep over this - seriously! My cell is (650) 555-8888.

Looking forward to strategizing together,

Michael

P.S. - Fun fact: There are over 300 active trademarks with "IRIS" in them. The trademark office deals with this all the time. We just need to show why yours is different enough to coexist with theirs.
