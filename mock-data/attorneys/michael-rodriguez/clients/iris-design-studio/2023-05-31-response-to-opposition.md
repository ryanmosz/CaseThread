Re: **IRIS DESIGN STUDIO - Response to Your Letter of May 15, 2023**  
    **Application Serial No. 97/123,456**

Dear Mr. Hamilton:

Thank you for your letter regarding the IRIS DESIGN STUDIO trademark application. I appreciate your client's preference for an amicable resolution, and I share that goal. After carefully reviewing your arguments and consulting with my client, I write to clarify some important facts and propose a practical solution.

## Prior Use Rights

First and foremost, Iris Design Studio has been operating under this name since **2015** - three years before your client began using IRIS CREATIVE. This prior use in commerce establishes significant common law rights that predate your client's federal registration. While we respect ICG's registered rights, those rights cannot override prior established use.

## Distinct Market Presence

Our clients operate in distinctly different markets:

**Iris Design Studio:**
- Small boutique studio in San Jose, California
- Primarily serves Bay Area tech startups and local businesses
- Personal referral-based business model
- Named after the founder's grandmother, a personal tribute

**Iris Creative Group:**
- New York-based agency
- Corporate clients on the East Coast
- Different business model and scale

The geographic and market separation significantly reduces any likelihood of confusion.

## The Confusion Evidence

While you mention three instances of confusion, let's put this in perspective:
- Over 8 years of concurrent use
- Thousands of combined client interactions
- Only 3 alleged instances (0.1% rate)

This minimal confusion actually demonstrates that the marks can coexist. Moreover, "Iris" is a common term with over 300 active trademark registrations - the USPTO regularly approves coexistence of marks with this element.

## A Practical Proposal

Rather than costly proceedings that benefit neither party, I propose we negotiate a coexistence agreement with the following framework:

**1. Geographic Considerations**
- ICG maintains priority in NY, NJ, CT (existing stronghold)
- IDS maintains priority in CA, OR, WA (existing presence)
- Neutral territories: both parties may operate with clear identifiers

**2. Use Requirements**
- IDS always uses "IRIS DESIGN STUDIO" (never just "IRIS")
- Both parties maintain distinct visual presentations
- Logo use emphasized in all marketing materials

**3. Future Expansion**
- 90-day notice before entering each other's priority markets
- Good faith discussions if conflicts arise
- Commitment to maintaining distinction

**4. Online Presence**
- Clear geographic identifiers in meta tags
- Distinct visual branding on websites
- No bidding on each other's exact match keywords

## The Business Reality

Let me be candid: forcing a small, woman-owned business to abandon a name honoring her grandmother after 8 years would be devastating - both financially and personally. My client recently invested significantly in rebranding and has built substantial local goodwill.

Conversely, your client faces uncertain and expensive opposition proceedings against a sympathetic opponent with prior use rights and a compelling personal story. The TTAB and courts often favor David over Goliath in these scenarios.

## Moving Forward

I believe reasonable business people can find a solution that protects both parties' interests. A coexistence agreement would:
- Save both parties significant legal fees
- Avoid 12-18 months of proceedings
- Preserve both brands' goodwill
- Allow focus on growing businesses, not fighting

I propose a phone conference in the next week to discuss specific coexistence terms. I'm available:
- June 6 at 2:00 PM PT
- June 7 at 10:00 AM PT
- June 8 at 3:00 PM PT

If these times don't work, please suggest alternatives.

## Conclusion

Your client has built a strong brand in New York. My client has done the same in California. With 3,000 miles between them and clear differences in presentation, there's room for both to thrive. Let's work together to formalize what's already working in practice.

I look forward to a productive discussion. Please confirm your availability for a call.

Best regards,

P.S. - I noticed your client's impressive portfolio on their website. My client actually admires their work, particularly the MoMA rebrand. Perhaps our clients have more in common than in conflict - creative professionals who chose a beautiful name for their businesses. Let's find a solution that honors both of their visions.
