Re: **Rainbow Tales Publishing / Stellar Stories Entertainment**  
    **Settlement Discussion**

Dear Michael:

Thank you for your September 22 response and for the productive phone call yesterday. As discussed, I'm writing to memorialize our progress toward resolution.

## Acknowledgments

After reviewing the materials you provided, we acknowledge:
- The November 2018 drawing is compelling evidence of independent creation
- Your client's self-publishing predates our client's broadcast
- The educational focus does distinguish the properties
- Litigation would not serve either party's interests

My client was unaware of your client's earlier work and appreciates the clarification. The similarities remain concerning, but we agree that parallel creation of space-themed cats is plausible given current trends.

## Revised Proposal

Based on our discussion and my client's authorization, Stellar Stories proposes:

### 1. Coexistence Agreement
Both parties may continue using their respective marks with these parameters:

**Rainbow Tales:**
- Continue using "Cosmic Cat" for publishing
- Add "Educational Adventures" to future marketing (not required on book covers)
- Maintain focus on STEM education messaging
- Avoid animation rights for 5 years

**Stellar Stories:**
- Continue "Cosmo the Space Cat" for entertainment
- Acknowledge Rainbow Tales' prior book rights
- No objection to your client's existing trademark application
- Avoid educational publishing market

### 2. Settlement Terms
- **Payment:** $25,000 (reduced from $500,000)
- **Purpose:** Business resolution and mutual releases
- **No admission** of wrongdoing by either party
- **Mutual non-disparagement** provisions

### 3. Collaboration Option
Our client remains interested in your partnership suggestion:
- Rainbow Tales provides educational content
- Stellar Stories handles animation/distribution
- Revenue sharing for any joint products
- Separate agreement to be negotiated

### 4. Immediate Actions
- Stellar Stories will not file opposition to pending trademark
- Rainbow Tales can continue all current operations
- Both parties cease any negative commentary
- 30-day period to finalize agreement

## The Human Element

Off the record - I was moved by the story of Ms. Walsh's daughter inspiring the character. As a mother myself, I understand the personal connection. My client's CEO, also a parent, specifically asked me to find a solution that honors both creative visions.

Your point about both space cats "soaring" resonated. There's room in the universe for multiple feline astronauts, especially when one teaches children about science.

## Next Steps

I'm sending a draft coexistence agreement separately. The key points:

1. Clear territorial boundaries (entertainment vs. education)
2. Mutual respect for each other's markets
3. Option for future collaboration
4. Modest payment for business certainty

Please review with your client. I believe this framework addresses everyone's concerns while avoiding costly litigation. My client is eager to resolve this before their October 20 Season 2 premiere.

I'm available for another call early next week. Perhaps we can finalize terms by October 6?

## Personal Note

Thank you for your professionalism and creativity in finding solutions. Your suggestion about collaboration turned a conflict into potential opportunity. This is why I still love practicing law after 20 years - finding ways for creative people to create, not fight.

Best regards,

Victoria Sterling

P.S. - My 8-year-old daughter loves both cosmic cats. She asked if they could be friends in space. Perhaps that's the best solution of all - let the characters coexist as peacefully as our clients will.
