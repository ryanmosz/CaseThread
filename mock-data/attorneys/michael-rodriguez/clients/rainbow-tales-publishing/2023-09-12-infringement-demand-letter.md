Re: **Copyright and Trademark Infringement - "Cosmic Cat" Character**  
    **Our Client: Stellar Stories Entertainment, LLC**

Dear Mr. Rodriguez:

We represent Stellar Stories Entertainment, LLC ("Stellar Stories"), a leading children's entertainment company that has been creating and distributing animated content since 2016. We write regarding your client Rainbow Tales Publishing's unauthorized use of character elements that infringe upon our client's intellectual property rights.

**Our Client's Prior Rights**

Stellar Stories owns the following registered intellectual property:

1. **Copyright Registration VA 2-111-222** (effective March 15, 2019)
   - "Cosmo the Space Cat" animated series bible
   - Character designs, storylines, and universe elements

2. **Trademark Registration No. 5,678,901** (registered October 20, 2020)
   - COSMO THE SPACE CAT for entertainment services, books, and merchandise
   - Classes 9, 16, 25, 28, 41

3. **Copyright Registrations VA 2-333-444 through VA 2-333-456** (2019-2021)
   - Thirteen episodes of the animated series
   - Broadcast on major streaming platforms since 2020

**The Infringement**

Our investigation reveals that Rainbow Tales Publishing's "Cosmic Cat" series contains numerous elements that infringe our client's copyrights:

**Character Similarities:**
- Both feature a purple/blue cat protagonist who travels through space
- Both cats wear similar silver space suits with constellation patterns
- Both have a signature "cosmic paw print" logo
- Both use a spaceship shaped like a crescent moon
- Both have a sidekick character that is a talking star

**Story Elements:**
- Episode 3 of our series: "Cosmo Visits the Red Planet" (aired April 2020)
- Your book: "Cosmic Cat Goes to Mars" (published April 2022)
- Identical plot points including: meteor shower obstacle, friendly Mars rover encounter, discovery of ice crystals

**Visual Expression:**
- Side-by-side comparison (enclosed as Exhibit A) shows substantial similarity
- Your illustrator appears to have copied our character's distinctive ear tufts, tail rings, and facial expressions
- Background star patterns match our proprietary "Cosmo Constellation" designs

**Evidence of Access**

Jennifer Walsh, principal of Rainbow Tales:
- Attended the 2020 Children's Media Summit where our series premiered
- Posted on Instagram (since deleted): "Loving the space cat trend! #cosmocats"
- Connected on LinkedIn with our head of creative development in January 2021

**Damages**

Our client has suffered substantial damages:
- Confused consumers asking if the books are series tie-ins
- Lost licensing opportunity with major publisher who cited market confusion
- Dilution of the COSMO THE SPACE CAT trademark
- Estimated damages exceed $500,000

**DEMAND**

We hereby demand that Rainbow Tales Publishing immediately:

1. **CEASE AND DESIST** all distribution, sales, and marketing of the "Cosmic Cat" series
2. **RECALL** all books from retailers and distributors
3. **DESTROY** all remaining inventory and marketing materials
4. **TRANSFER** the domain cosmiccat.com to our client
5. **PROVIDE** a full accounting of all sales and profits
6. **PAY** damages in an amount to be determined, but no less than $500,000

**Settlement Opportunity**

If Rainbow Tales acts quickly, our client is willing to discuss:
- A phase-out period of 60 days for existing inventory
- Potential co-branding opportunities
- Reduced damages payment of $250,000
- Mutual non-disparagement agreement

However, this offer expires on **October 12, 2023**. After that date, we will file suit in federal court seeking:
- Injunctive relief
- Actual damages and profits
- Statutory damages up to $150,000 per work
- Attorney's fees

**Response Required**

Given the clear infringement and our client's significant investment in the Cosmo character (over $3 million in development and marketing), we trust you will advise your client to accept the settlement terms.

Please respond within thirty (30) days. Time is of the essence, as our client's animated series Season 2 launches next month, and market confusion must be eliminated.

Sincerely,

**/s/ Victoria Sterling**
