# Task 6.8: Provisional Patent Application Signature/Initial Blocks

## Task 6.8.1: Investigate signature/initial requirements and positions
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Investigation Results

1. **Document Type**: Provisional Patent Application for USPTO filing

2. **Signature Requirements**:
   - Inventor signature(s) required
   - Optional witness signature
   - Location: End of document after abstract

3. **Signature Components**:
   - Name
   - Date
   - No title field (inventor status is clear from context)

4. **Initial Blocks**: Not required for provisional patent applications

5. **Notarization**: Not required

6. **Current Issue**: Template had generic placeholders ([SIGNATURE_BLOCK:*], [INITIALS_BLOCK:*])

## Task 6.8.2: Implement blocks and test
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation

1. **Followed TDD Process**:
   - Wrote tests first (6 new tests)
   - Watched them fail (red phase)
   - Implemented signature blocks
   - All tests pass (green phase)

2. **Added signature section** (section 11):
   ```json
   {
     "id": "signatures",
     "title": "Signatures",
     "order": 11,
     "required": true,
     "content": "\n\nSignature(s):\n\n[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:inventor-signature]\n\n[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:witness-signature]",
     "firmCustomizable": false
   }
   ```

3. **Added signatureBlocks**:
   - `inventor-signature`: Required inventor signature with name and date
   - `witness-signature`: Optional witness signature with name and date

### Testing Report
- **Tests Created**: 6 new tests
- **Test Results**: 311 passed, 0 failed (was 306 total before)
- **Coverage**: Signature block definition, markers in content, schema validation, inventor-specific tests
- **Test Modifications**: None - all tests passed as written
- **Issues**: None

### Generated Document Verification
- Successfully generated provisional patent application
- Inventor signature marker appears correctly after abstract
- Witness signature marker appears in template but may be omitted if not needed
