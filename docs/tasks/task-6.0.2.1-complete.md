# Task 6.0.2.1 Complete - Create PDF Generation IPC Handler

## Summary

Successfully implemented the main process IPC handler for PDF generation requests, enabling secure communication between the renderer and main processes for PDF operations.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/pdf-ipc.ts`)
- `PDFGenerateRequest` - Request structure with validation
- `PDFGenerateResponse` - Response with success/error handling
- `PDFProgressUpdate` - Progress event structure
- `PDFErrorCode` enum - Standardized error codes
- `PDFGenerationOptions` - Configuration options

### 2. IPC Channels (`src/electron/constants/pdf-channels.ts`)
- Defined all PDF-related IPC channels
- Created channel validation helper
- Separated invoke channels (renderer→main) from event channels (main→renderer)

### 3. PDF Generation Handler (`src/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.ts`)
- Singleton pattern implementation
- Request validation for all 8 document types
- Progress event conversion from ProgressEvent to IPC format
- Abort controller for cancellation support
- Memory management for active requests
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Window state detection (prevents sending to destroyed windows)
- Time estimation for progress updates

### 4. Main Process Integration (`src/electron/main/index.ts`)
- Handler initialization on app ready
- Cleanup on app quit
- Proper lifecycle management

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite (`__tests__/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.test.ts`)
- 22 test cases covering all functionality
- Mock IPC event handling
- Progress calculation verification
- Error handling scenarios
- Cancellation testing
- Window state handling

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Progress Event Conversion**: The PDFServiceFactory expects a ProgressCallback that takes a ProgressEvent, while our IPC needs simpler string messages. We convert between these formats in the handler.

2. **Request Tracking**: Each request has a unique ID and is tracked with an AbortController for cancellation support.

3. **Security**: All requests are validated before processing, including document type, options ranges, and required fields.

4. **Memory Management**: Active requests are cleaned up on completion or app quit to prevent memory leaks.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `src/types/pdf-ipc.ts`
- `src/electron/constants/pdf-channels.ts`
- `src/electron/constants/index.ts`
- `src/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.ts`
- `__tests__/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.test.ts`

### Modified:
- `src/electron/main/index.ts` - Added handler initialization
- Test count increased from 672 to 694 (22 new tests)

## Test Results

All 694 tests passing, including:
- ✅ IPC handler registration
- ✅ PDF generation flow
- ✅ Progress updates
- ✅ Request validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Cancellation
- ✅ Active request management
- ✅ Progress calculation
- ✅ Window state handling

## Next Steps

Continue with Task 6.0.2.2 - Implement progress reporting IPC channel, which will:
- Create dedicated progress channel handlers
- Implement progress event streaming
- Add progress state management
- Enable real-time updates in the GUI
