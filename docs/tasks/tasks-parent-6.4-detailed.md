# Task 6.4: Cease and Desist Letter Signature/Initial Blocks

**Part of Parent Task 6.0: Update JSON Templates with Signature Block Definitions**

## Overview

Investigate and implement signature blocks, initial blocks, and placement markers for the Cease and Desist Letter template. Cease and desist letters follow a formal business letter format with single attorney signature.

## Sub-tasks

### 6.4.1 Investigate signature/initial requirements and positions

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Generate sample document for analysis:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate cease-and-desist-letter docs/testing/scenario-inputs/tfs-05-cease-desist-cacheflow.yaml
   ```

2. **Analyze generated document structure:**
   - Review business letter format
   - Identify closing section
   - Note attorney signature placement
   - Check for any initial requirements

3. **Research legal requirements:**
   - Standard business letter format
   - Attorney signature after closing
   - Attorney contact information below signature
   - No witness or notary requirements
   - No initials typically required

4. **Document findings:**
   - Map document structure
   - Identify signature placement
   - Note field requirements
   - Consider formal letter conventions

**Expected Findings:**
- Main signature: After "Sincerely," in closing section
- Layout: Single signature block
- Initials: Not typically required
- Fields needed: Attorney name, firm, contact info
- Special: Formal business letter format

**Investigation Output:**

### Document Structure:
1. Header (Date, Via, Recipient, Re:)
2. Opening
3. IP Ownership
4. Infringement Description
5. Legal Basis
6. Demands
7. Consequences
8. Closing

Sincerely,

[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:attorney-signature]

[ATTORNEY NAME]
[FIRM NAME]
[PHONE]
[EMAIL]

Attorney for [Client]
```

## ACTUAL INVESTIGATION FINDINGS (2025-01-08)

### Document Structure Analysis:
The generated cease and desist letter follows this business letter structure:
1. **Header**: Date, delivery method (CERTIFIED MAIL), recipient info, Re: line
2. **Opening**: Formal greeting and introduction
3. **IP Ownership**: Description of client's intellectual property
4. **Infringement Description**: Details of how IP is being infringed
5. **Legal Basis**: Relevant statutes and potential penalties
6. **Demands**: Numbered list of required actions
7. **Consequences**: Warning about legal action if non-compliant
8. **Closing**: Final statement, deadline, and signature block

### Key Findings:
1. **Single Signature Required**:
   - Attorney signs on behalf of the client
   - No co-signatures or witness requirements
   - Standard business letter signature format

2. **Signature Placement**:
   - Appears after "Sincerely," in the closing section
   - Current template has placeholders: [ATTORNEY NAME], [FIRM NAME], [PHONE], [EMAIL]
   - Marker should be placed between "Sincerely," and attorney name

3. **No Initial Blocks Needed**:
   - Cease and desist letters don't require page initials
   - No section-specific acknowledgments needed
   - Single attorney signature suffices

4. **Fields Required**:
   - Attorney name (always required)
   - Firm name (optional but common)
   - Phone (optional but common)
   - Email (optional but common)
   - No date field needed (date appears at top of letter)

5. **Special Considerations**:
   - Professional business letter format is standard
   - "Attorney for [Client]" appears at the very end
   - Some firms may include attorney bar number
   - Electronic delivery may affect signature format

### Template Current State:
The closing section already includes placeholders for attorney information but needs a proper signature block definition with the marker positioned correctly.

### 6.4.2 Implement blocks and test

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update cease-and-desist-letter.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "cease-and-desist-letter",
     "name": "Cease and Desist Letter",
     "description": "...",
     "sections": [...],
     "signatureBlocks": [
       {
         "id": "sender-signature",
         "type": "single",
         "placement": {
           "location": "after-closing-salutation",
           "marker": "[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:sender-signature]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "sender",
           "label": "",
           "fields": {
             "name": { "required": true, "label": "Name" },
             "title": { "required": true, "label": "Title" },
             "company": { 
               "required": false, 
               "label": "Law Firm/Company" 
             },
             "registrationNumber": {
               "required": false,
               "label": "Bar No."
             }
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Consider professional formatting:**
   - No label needed (formal letter format)
   - Title is required for authority
   - Law firm typically included
   - Bar number may be required in some jurisdictions

3. **Test template loading:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test -- __tests__/services/template.test.ts
   ```

4. **Test document generation with marker:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate cease-and-desist-letter docs/testing/scenario-inputs/cil-05-cease-desist-false-claims.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify marker placement:**
   - Check that `[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:sender-signature]` appears after "Sincerely,"
   - Ensure proper spacing for formal letter
   - Verify professional appearance maintained

6. **Test different sender types:**
   - Attorney with bar number
   - Corporate representative
   - Individual rights holder

7. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test
   ```

## Testing Approach

1. **Template Loading Test:**
   - Verify template loads with signature block
   - Check all fields accessible
   - Ensure backward compatibility

2. **Document Generation Test:**
   - Generate with attorney sender
   - Generate with corporate sender
   - Verify formal letter format preserved

3. **Professional Standards:**
   - Marker placement maintains formality
   - Spacing appropriate for business letter
   - All professional fields included

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Investigation complete with documented findings
- [ ] Letter structure mapped
- [ ] JSON template updated with signature block
- [ ] Professional fields included
- [ ] Placement directive specified
- [ ] Marker appears after closing salutation
- [ ] Works for different sender types
- [ ] Template loading tests pass
- [ ] Document generation successful
- [ ] Full test suite passes

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Breaking letter format** - Maintain formal structure
2. **Missing title** - Authority must be clear
3. **Incorrect placement** - Must be after closing
4. **Too many fields** - Keep professional and clean
5. **Forgetting bar number** - May be legally required

## Notes

- Cease and desist letters require professional presentation
- Signature establishes sender's authority
- Format follows formal business letter conventions
- No initials needed in standard practice
- Consider jurisdiction-specific requirements
