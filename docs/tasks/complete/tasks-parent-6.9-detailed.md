# Task 6.9: Technology Transfer Agreement Signature/Initial Blocks

**Part of Parent Task 6.0: Update JSON Templates with Signature Block Definitions**

## Overview

Investigate and implement signature blocks, initial blocks, and placement markers for the Technology Transfer Agreement template. This is a complex agreement involving multiple parties and technology transfer provisions.

## Sub-tasks

### 6.9.1 Investigate signature/initial requirements and positions

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Generate sample document for analysis:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate technology-transfer-agreement docs/testing/scenario-inputs/rtp-03-tech-transfer-animation.yaml
   ```

2. **Analyze generated document structure:**
   - Review technology description sections
   - Identify payment/milestone areas
   - Note confidentiality provisions
   - Find signature requirements

3. **Research legal requirements:**
   - Technology transfer often requires both parties
   - May need witness signatures
   - Export control acknowledgments common
   - IP assignment confirmations

4. **Document findings:**
   - Map agreement structure
   - Identify signature locations
   - Consider multiple party scenarios
   - Note special provisions

**Expected Findings:**
- Main signatures: Both parties (Provider and Recipient)
- Layout: Side-by-side for equal parties
- Initials: May be needed for IP assignment sections
- Fields needed: Name, Title, Company, Date
- Special: Export control acknowledgments

**Investigation Output:**

## Technology Transfer Agreement Placement Map

### Agreement Structure:
1. Parties and Recitals
2. Technology Description
3. Grant of Rights
4. Payment Terms
5. Confidentiality
6. IP Ownership
7. Export Controls
8. General Terms
9. Signatures

IN WITNESS WHEREOF...

TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER:        TECHNOLOGY RECIPIENT:
[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:provider]  [SIGNATURE_BLOCK:recipient]
```

### Investigation Complete ✓

**Findings:**

1. **Signature Requirements:**
   - Provider Signature (Technology Provider) - End of document
   - Recipient Signature (Technology Recipient) - End of document
   - Both require Name, Title, Date fields

2. **Initial Block Requirements:**
   - Technology Transfer Section (Grant of rights) - Critical
   - Financial Terms Section (Payment obligations) - Critical  
   - Intellectual Property Section (Ownership provisions) - Critical
   - Export Control Section (When present) - Critical for compliance

3. **Special Considerations:**
   - May require witness signatures for university/research transfers
   - Export controlled technology may need export control officer acknowledgment
   - Supports both assignment and license structures

### 6.9.2 Implement blocks and test

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update technology-transfer-agreement.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "technology-transfer-agreement",
     "name": "Technology Transfer Agreement",
     "description": "...",
     "sections": [...],
     "signatureBlocks": [
       {
         "id": "provider-signature",
         "type": "single",
         "layout": "side-by-side",
         "placement": {
           "location": "after-witness-clause",
           "marker": "[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:provider-signature]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "technology-provider",
           "label": "TECHNOLOGY PROVIDER",
           "entityName": "{{provider_name}}",
           "fields": {
             "name": { "required": true, "label": "Name" },
             "title": { "required": true, "label": "Title" },
             "date": { "required": true, "label": "Date" }
           }
         }
       },
       {
         "id": "recipient-signature",
         "type": "single",
         "layout": "side-by-side",
         "placement": {
           "location": "after-witness-clause",
           "marker": "[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:recipient-signature]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "technology-recipient",
           "label": "TECHNOLOGY RECIPIENT",
           "entityName": "{{recipient_name}}",
           "fields": {
             "name": { "required": true, "label": "Name" },
             "title": { "required": true, "label": "Title" },
             "date": { "required": true, "label": "Date" }
           }
         }
       }
     ],
     "initialBlocks": [
       {
         "id": "export-control-initials",
         "placement": {
           "location": "export-control-section",
           "marker": "[INITIALS_BLOCK:export-control]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "both-parties",
           "label": "Provider: ___ Recipient: ___"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Handle export control acknowledgments:**
   - Add initial blocks for sensitive sections
   - Both parties initial export restrictions
   - Clear acknowledgment of compliance

3. **Test template loading:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test -- __tests__/services/template.test.ts
   ```

4. **Test document generation with markers:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate technology-transfer-agreement test-tech-transfer.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify marker placement:**
   - Check side-by-side signatures
   - Verify export control initials if applicable
   - Ensure professional formatting
   - Check both party blocks present

6. **Test complex scenarios:**
   - With export restrictions
   - Without export restrictions
   - Multiple milestones
   - Various payment structures

7. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test
   ```
