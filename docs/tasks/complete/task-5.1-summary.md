# Task 5.1 Summary: Architecture Analysis Plan

## Overview
We'll analyze the current PDF service to understand what needs to be refactored for GUI integration. The main issue is that the service is currently tightly coupled to the CLI and file system.

## Key Analysis Points

### 1. **Current Problems**
- Service writes directly to files (GUI needs buffer/stream)
- Progress callbacks tied to CLI spinner
- Console logging throughout
- Components created internally (hard to mock/test)

### 2. **What We'll Examine**
- All file system dependencies
- CLI-specific coupling points
- Component communication patterns
- Current API limitations
- Data flow from text to PDF

### 3. **Main Deliverables**
1. **Dependency Map** - What depends on what
2. **Coupling Report** - What's tied to CLI/filesystem
3. **Refactoring Plan** - What needs to change
4. **New API Design** - How GUI will use it

## Time Required
~2 hours for complete analysis

## Expected Outcome
A clear understanding of:
- What needs to be abstracted (file I/O, progress, logging)
- What can stay the same (core PDF logic)
- How to make the service return buffers instead of writing files
- How to handle progress in a UI-agnostic way

## Next Step
Once analysis is complete, we'll move to Task 5.2: Extract Core PDF Service, where we'll implement the refactoring based on our findings.
