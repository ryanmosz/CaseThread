# Developer R - Task Priority List

## 📢 IMPORTANT UPDATE: Task Structure Clarification
**Sections have been refactored to match Task 2.0 structure exactly**
- Section 2 now contains ALL of Parent Task 2.0 (Tasks 2.1-2.7)
- Section 3 (duplicate signature blocks) has been removed
- Following the structured task list in `docs/tasks/tasks-parent-2.0-checklist.md`

### Task Mapping:
- **Section 2** = Entire Parent Task 2.0 (35 sub-tasks)
  - ✅ PDFKit setup = Task 2.1 (Complete - 4/4 sub-tasks)
  - ✅ PDF architecture = Task 2.2 (Complete - 5/5 sub-tasks)
  - ✅ Formatting rules = Task 2.3 (Complete - 5/5 sub-tasks)
  - ✅ Signature parser = Task 2.4 (Complete - 5/5 sub-tasks)
  - ✅ Layout engine = Task 2.5 (Complete - 5/5 sub-tasks)
  - 📋 CLI command = Task 2.6 (Not started - 0/5 sub-tasks)
  - 📋 Testing = Task 2.7 (Not started - 0/5 sub-tasks)
- **Section 3** = Task 2.6 (CLI command) - redundant but kept for clarity
- **Section 4** = Task 2.7 (Testing) - redundant but kept for clarity
- **Section 5** = Post-Task 2.0 integration work

### Task 2.0 Progress Summary:
- **Complete**: 24 of 35 sub-tasks (69%)
- **In Progress**: None - ready to start Task 2.6
- **Next Up**: Task 2.6.1 (Create export command structure)
- **Tests**: 506 passing (162 PDF-related tests, 9 need fixes)
