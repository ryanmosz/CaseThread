# Task 6.7: Patent License Agreement Signature/Initial Blocks

## Task 6.7.1: Investigate signature/initial requirements and positions
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Investigation Results

1. **Document Type**: Patent License Agreement between Licensor and Licensee

2. **Signature Requirements**:
   - Two signatures required: Licensor and Licensee
   - Side-by-side layout appropriate for equal parties
   - Location: End of document after "IN WITNESS WHEREOF" clause

3. **Signature Components**:
   - Name
   - Title  
   - Date

4. **Initial Blocks**: Not required for patent license agreements

5. **Notarization**: Not required

6. **Current Issue**: Template had redundant "By: ____" lines and placeholder text

## Task 6.7.2: Implement blocks and test
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation

1. **Updated signature section**: 
   - Removed redundant "By: ____" lines
   - Removed placeholder text for Name/Title/Date
   - Added `[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:licensor-signature]` and `[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:licensee-signature]`

2. **Added signatureBlocks definition**:
   - Two blocks with side-by-side layout
   - Licensor and Licensee with appropriate party labels
   - Standard fields: name, title, date (all required)
   - Used standard structure with placement and party objects

3. **Template Changes**:
   - Cleaned up redundant signature text
   - Added proper signature block markers
   - Result: Clean, consistent signature area

### Testing Report (TDD Approach)

## Testing Report
- Tests Created: 6 new tests
- Test Results: 37 passed, 0 failed (306 total tests pass)
- Coverage: 
  - Patent License Agreement has signatureBlocks defined
  - Signature markers appear in content
  - No redundant signature text remains
  - Document generation includes markers
  - Schema validation passes
  - Two-party signature structure verified
- Test Modifications: Fixed test to check label in party object instead of directly on block
- Issues: None - all tests passing

### Verification
- Generated document confirms markers appear correctly:
  - `[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:licensor-signature]`
  - `[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:licensee-signature]`
- Markers positioned after "IN WITNESS WHEREOF" clause as expected
