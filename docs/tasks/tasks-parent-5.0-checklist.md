# Task Checklist: Parent Task 5.0 - Build CLI Interface with Commander

## Relevant Files

- `src/index.ts` - CLI entry point with shebang and Commander setup
- `src/commands/generate.ts` - Generate command implementation
- `src/types/index.ts` - Type definitions (may need CLI-specific types)
- `__tests__/commands/generate.test.ts` - Unit tests for generate command
- `__tests__/index.test.ts` - Unit tests for CLI entry point
- `__tests__/integration/cli.integration.test.ts` - Integration tests for full CLI flow

### Notes

- Unit tests should be created alongside implementation for each subtask
- Use `docker exec casethread-dev npm test` to run tests inside container
- Follow existing patterns from services already implemented
- Reference existing services (template, yaml, openai, spinner, logger, validator)

## Tasks

- [ ] 5.0 Build CLI interface with Commander
  - [ ] 5.1 Create src/index.ts with shebang and Commander setup (Details: tasks-parent-5.1-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.2 Implement src/commands/generate.ts with document type and input path arguments (Details: tasks-parent-5.2-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.3 Add --output flag for custom output directory with default to current directory (Details: tasks-parent-5.3-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.4 Integrate spinner updates throughout the generation process (Details: tasks-parent-5.4-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.5 Implement error handling with user-friendly messages and exit codes (Details: tasks-parent-5.5-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.6 Add --debug flag to enable verbose logging (Details: tasks-parent-5.6-detailed.md)
  - [ ] 5.7 Create output file with timestamp-based naming pattern (Details: tasks-parent-5.7-detailed.md)

## Testing Requirements

Each subtask must include:
1. Unit tests for new functionality
2. Integration with existing services verified
3. Manual testing inside Docker container
4. All tests passing before marking complete
