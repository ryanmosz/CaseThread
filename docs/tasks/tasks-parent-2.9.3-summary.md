# Task 2.9.3 Summary: Ensure Content Flows Properly

## Status: COMPLETE

## Summary
Implemented a two-pass rendering system to improve content flow and reduce pagination issues. The system measures content before rendering to make better page break decisions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Two-Pass Rendering Architecture
- **First Pass**: Measures all content blocks to get accurate heights
- **Second Pass**: Renders content with pre-calculated measurements
- Eliminates guesswork in page break calculations

### 2. New Methods Added

#### PDFExportService
- `measureContentForPageBreaks()` - Measures all pages and blocks
- `measureBlock()` - Measures individual block heights
- `renderPageWithMeasurements()` - Renders with known measurements
- `renderBlock()` - Renders individual blocks (refactored from renderPage)

#### LegalPDFGenerator
- `measureTextHeight()` - Public method for accurate text measurement

### 3. New Types Added (src/types/pdf.ts)
```typescript
export interface BlockMeasurement {
  type: string;
  estimatedHeight: number;
  actualHeight: number;
  canSplit: boolean;
}

export interface PageMeasurements {
  blocks: BlockMeasurement[];
  totalHeight: number;
  hasSignatureBlock: boolean;
}
```

### 4. Signature Block Protection
- Checks remaining space before rendering signature blocks
- Moves entire signature block to next page if insufficient space
- Prevents signature blocks from splitting across pages

## Results
- Better content flow with pre-measured heights
- Signature blocks protected from page splits
- Foundation for future improvements
- All 597 tests passing

## Testing
- Created test document with multiple signature blocks
- Verified signature blocks don't split across pages
- Layout engine calculates correct page count
- No regression in existing functionality

## Remaining Issues
- PDFKit still auto-paginates when content overflows
- Some blank pages still occur with complex layouts
- Need more comprehensive testing with various document types

## Next Steps
1. Task 2.9.4: Test with various document lengths
2. Consider implementing smart text splitting at sentence boundaries
3. Add more sophisticated orphan/widow control
4. Optimize layout calculations for better accuracy
