# Task 6.0.2.2 Complete - Implement Progress Reporting IPC Channel

## Summary
Successfully implemented a dedicated IPC channel system for streaming progress updates from the main process to the renderer during PDF generation. The implementation includes batching, throttling, and proper cleanup to ensure optimal performance.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ProgressManager (`src/electron/main/ipc/progress-manager.ts`)
- Singleton pattern for centralized progress management
- Batches updates every 100ms to prevent overwhelming the renderer
- Handles WebContents lifecycle (cleanup on destroy)
- Provides both batched and immediate update methods
- Includes comprehensive subscription management

Key features:
- Auto-cleanup of destroyed WebContents
- Update queue management per request
- Configurable batch processing interval
- Error handling with automatic unsubscribe

### 2. ProgressHandlers (`src/electron/main/ipc/progress-handlers.ts`)
- IPC handlers for subscription management
- Three main channels:
  - `pdf:subscribe-progress` - Subscribe to updates
  - `pdf:unsubscribe-progress` - Unsubscribe from updates
  - `pdf:get-active-progress` - Debug/monitoring endpoint

### 3. PDF Generation Handler Updates
- Integrated with ProgressManager for centralized control
- Maintains backward compatibility (direct send + progress manager)
- Cleanup includes progress unsubscription

### 4. React Hook (`src/electron/renderer/src/hooks/usePDFProgress.ts`)
- Feature-rich hook for progress tracking in components
- Options for history tracking, auto-clear, and more
- Helper methods: `isComplete`, `isInProgress`, `getProgress`
- Automatic subscription/unsubscription on mount/unmount

### 5. Preload Script Updates
- Added PDF operations to the electron API
- Event listeners for progress updates
- Type-safe API methods

### 6. Main Process Integration
- ProgressHandlers initialized in `src/electron/main/index.ts`
- Cleanup on app quit to prevent memory leaks

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive tests in `__tests__/electron/main/ipc/progress-manager.test.ts`:
- Subscription management (add, remove, query)
- Batch processing (throttling, queuing)
- Error handling (destroyed WebContents, send failures)
- Cleanup operations (final update processing)
- Multiple concurrent subscriptions

All 16 tests passing successfully.

## Channels Added

```typescript
// Progress subscription channels
SUBSCRIBE_PROGRESS: 'pdf:subscribe-progress',
UNSUBSCRIBE_PROGRESS: 'pdf:unsubscribe-progress',
GET_ACTIVE_PROGRESS: 'pdf:get-active-progress',
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In renderer component
const { progress, isComplete, error } = usePDFProgress(requestId, {
  keepHistory: true,
  autoClear: true,
  autoClearDelay: 5000,
});

// Progress state
if (progress) {
  console.log(`Current step: ${progress.currentStep}`);
  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.percentage}%`);
  console.log(`ETA: ${progress.estimatedTimeRemaining}s`);
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Batching**: Updates batched every 100ms
2. **Latest-only**: Only sends most recent update per batch
3. **Auto-cleanup**: Removes destroyed WebContents automatically
4. **Memory management**: Clears queues after processing
5. **Subscription tracking**: Efficient Map-based lookups

## Integration Points

- Works seamlessly with existing `PDFGenerationHandler`
- Compatible with `BackgroundGenerationContext`
- Ready for use in `EnhancedDocumentViewer` component
- Supports multiple concurrent PDF generations

## Next Steps

- Task 6.0.2.3: Add PDF export IPC handler
- Task 6.0.2.4: Create IPC security validation
- Future: Consider progress persistence for recovery
