# Task 2.9.2 Summary: Fix Page Break Logic

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Space Checking Before Writing (LegalPDFGenerator)
- Added `calculateTextHeight()` method using PDFKit's `heightOfString()`
- Check remaining space before writing text
- Manual page break if text won't fit
- Added height limit to `text()` calls to prevent overflow

### 2. Improved Page Management (PDFExportService)
- Track expected vs actual pages
- Only call `newPage()` if PDFKit hasn't already created pages
- Added warnings when PDFKit creates extra pages

### 3. Conservative Height Limits (PDFLayoutEngine)
- Reduced max page height from 648pt to 580pt
- More conservative height calculations
- Added buffer to prevent edge case overflows

## Results
- **Partial Success**: Reduced blank pages in some cases
- **Still Issues**: PDFKit continues to auto-paginate when content overflows
- **Root Cause**: Height calculations still don't perfectly match PDFKit's rendering

## Code Changes

### src/services/pdf/LegalPDFGenerator.ts
- Added space checking in `writeText()`
- Added `calculateTextHeight()` method
- Added height limit to PDFKit text() calls
- Added debug logging for page creation

### src/services/pdf-export.ts
- Improved page management logic
- Track expected vs actual pages
- Better height calculation with wrapping estimation

### src/services/pdf/PDFLayoutEngine.ts
- Reduced maximum page height to 580pt
- More conservative page creation

## Remaining Issues
1. PDFKit still auto-paginates when our calculations are off
2. Height calculations don't account for all PDFKit behaviors
3. Need better understanding of PDFKit's text flow algorithm

## Next Steps for Task 2.9.3
1. Consider using PDFKit's text measurement APIs more extensively
2. Implement two-pass rendering (measure first, then render)
3. Or accept PDFKit's pagination and work with it instead of against it
