# Task 6.9: Technology Transfer Agreement Signature/Initial Blocks

**Part of Parent Task 6.0: Update JSON Templates with Signature Block Definitions**

## Overview

Investigate and implement signature blocks, initial blocks, and placement markers for the Technology Transfer Agreement template. These agreements typically involve universities or research institutions transferring technology to commercial entities and may require multiple approval signatures.

## Sub-tasks

### 6.9.1 Investigate signature/initial requirements and positions

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Generate sample document for analysis:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate technology-transfer-agreement docs/testing/scenario-inputs/cil-06-tech-transfer-manufacturing.yaml
   ```

2. **Analyze generated document structure:**
   - Review technology description
   - Identify payment/milestone terms
   - Note intellectual property provisions
   - Find compliance requirements

3. **Research legal requirements:**
   - Transferor and transferee signatures required
   - May need institutional approval
   - Initials on IP assignment sections
   - Witness signatures sometimes required
   - Compliance officer approval possible

4. **Document findings:**
   - Map agreement structure
   - Identify sections needing initials
   - Note approval hierarchy
   - Consider institutional requirements

**Expected Findings:**
- Main signatures: End of agreement
- Layout: Side-by-side for main parties
- Initials: On technology description, IP terms
- Fields needed: Name, Title, Institution/Company
- Special: May need department head approval

**Investigation Output:**

5. IP Ownership and Patents
6. Compliance and Regulatory
7. Warranties and Indemnification

Additional approval signatures may be required
```

### 6.9.2 Implement blocks and test

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update technology-transfer-agreement.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "technology-transfer-agreement",
     "name": "Technology Transfer Agreement",
     "description": "...",
     "sections": [...],

             "date": { "required": true, "label": "Date" }
           }
         }
       },
       {

         "placement": {
           "location": "after-main-signatures",

               "label": "Title (e.g., Dept. Head, Tech Transfer Officer)" 
             },
             "date": { "required": true, "label": "Date" }
           }
         },

       }
     ],
     "initialBlocks": [
       {
         "id": "transferor-initials",
         "placement": {
           "locations": [
             "after-technology-description",
             "after-payment-terms"
           ],
           "marker": "[INITIALS_BLOCK:transferor-initials]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "transferor",
           "label": "Transferor"
         }
       },
       {
         "id": "transferee-initials",
         "placement": {
           "locations": [
             "after-technology-description",
             "after-payment-terms"
           ],
           "marker": "[INITIALS_BLOCK:transferee-initials]"
         },
         "party": {
           "role": "transferee",
           "label": "Transferee"
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Handle institutional requirements:**
   - Main parties sign side-by-side
   - Optional approval signature below
   - Initials on key technology sections
   - Title fields important for authority

3. **Test template loading:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test -- __tests__/services/template.test.ts
   ```

4. **Test document generation with markers:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate technology-transfer-agreement docs/testing/scenario-inputs/cil-06-tech-transfer-manufacturing.yaml
   ```

5. **Verify marker placement:**
   - Main signatures side-by-side at end
   - Approval signature optional/conditional
   - Initials on technology and payment sections
   - Professional institutional format

6. **Test different scenarios:**
   - University to company transfer
   - Company to company transfer
   - With/without approval signatures
   - Different institutional structures

7. **Run full test suite:**
   ```bash
   docker exec casethread-dev npm test
   ```

## Testing Approach

1. **Template Loading Test:**
   - All signature blocks load (including optional)
   - Initial blocks properly configured
   - Backward compatibility maintained

2. **Document Generation Test:**
   - Generate complete agreement
   - Verify all markers placed correctly
   - Test optional approval block
   - Check institutional formatting

3. **Institutional Standards:**
   - Authority clearly indicated
   - Approval hierarchy supported
   - Professional appearance

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Investigation complete with documented findings
- [ ] Agreement structure mapped with initial points
- [ ] JSON template updated with all signature blocks
- [ ] Optional approval signature included
- [ ] Initial blocks on key sections
- [ ] All placement directives specified
- [ ] Markers appear correctly in output
- [ ] Side-by-side main signatures working
- [ ] Template loading tests pass
- [ ] Full test suite passes

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing approval signatures** - Institutions often require
2. **Wrong institution field** - Use "Institution" not "Company"
3. **Forgetting technology initials** - Important for clarity
4. **Title requirements** - Authority must be clear
5. **Complex approval chains** - Keep flexible

## Notes

- Technology transfer involves institutional complexities
- Approval signatures vary by institution
- Title fields critical for establishing authority
- Consider different institutional structures
- Payment terms and technology description need special attention
