# Using the Quality Pipeline for Better PDFs

## What is the Quality Pipeline?

The Quality Pipeline uses advanced AI to enhance your documents through multiple review stages:

1. **Context Building**: Analyzes document structure
2. **Drafting**: Enhances content quality
3. **Review**: Checks for legal compliance
4. **Finalization**: Applies professional formatting

## How to Enable

### Step 1: Open Settings
![Settings Menu](./images/settings-menu.png)

Navigate to **Settings â†’ Document Generation**

### Step 2: Enable Quality Pipeline
![Quality Toggle](./images/quality-toggle.png)

Toggle "Use Quality Pipeline" to ON

### Step 3: Configure Options
![Pipeline Options](./images/pipeline-options.png)

Choose your preferences:
- **Review Depth**: Standard or Thorough
- **Formatting Style**: Conservative or Modern
- **Compliance Level**: Basic or Strict

## Using Quality Pipeline

### Generation Process
![Pipeline Progress](./images/pipeline-progress.png)

When generating with pipeline:
1. Progress shows multiple stages
2. Each stage has its own progress
3. Total time is longer but quality is higher

### Understanding the Stages

#### Stage 1: Context Building (10-20%)
- Analyzing document type
- Extracting key information
- Building knowledge base

#### Stage 2: Drafting (20-60%)
- Enhancing content
- Fixing inconsistencies
- Improving clarity

#### Stage 3: Review (60-90%)
- Legal compliance check
- Format verification
- Quality assurance

#### Stage 4: Finalization (90-100%)
- Applying formatting
- Adding metadata
- Creating PDF

### Quality Score
![Quality Score](./images/quality-score.png)

After generation:
- See your document's quality score
- Review improvement suggestions
- Compare before/after if available

## Benefits

### Without Pipeline
- Basic formatting
- Quick generation
- Standard quality

### With Pipeline
- Professional formatting
- Enhanced content
- Legal compliance
- Quality guarantee

## When to Use

### Recommended For:
- Client deliverables
- Court filings
- Final documents
- Important agreements

### Optional For:
- Internal drafts
- Quick reviews
- Test documents
- Personal use

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start with complete content**: Pipeline enhances, doesn't create
2. **Allow enough time**: Process takes 2-5x longer
3. **Review suggestions**: Pipeline may flag issues
4. **Use templates**: Better starting point for pipeline

## Troubleshooting Pipeline Issues

### "Pipeline Failed at Stage X"
- Check stage-specific error
- Ensure document is valid
- Try without pipeline first
- Contact support with error code

### "Quality Score Low"
- Review suggestions panel
- Address flagged issues
- Re-run pipeline after fixes
- Consider template use
```
