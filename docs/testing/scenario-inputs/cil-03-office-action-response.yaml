title: "Biodegradable Polymer Compositions and Methods of Manufacture"

applicant:
  name: "ChemInnovate Labs, Inc."
  address: "456 Innovation Drive, Menlo Park, CA 94025"

inventors:
  - "Dr. Elena Vasquez"
  - "Dr. Michael Chang"

office_action:
  mailing_date: "2024-01-25"
  response_deadline: "2024-07-25"
  examiner: "Dr. Patricia Williams"
  art_unit: "1762"

rejections:
  - type: "35 U.S.C. 112(a) - Enablement"
    claims: ["1-20"]
    basis: "Specification fails to enable full scope of biodegradation in marine environments"
  - type: "35 U.S.C. 103 - Obviousness"
    claims: ["1-10"]
    prior_art: ["Thompson (US 9,123,456)", "Garcia et al. (WO 2019/123456)"]

amendments:
  claim_1:
    type: "Narrowing"
    change: "Added limitation requiring specific molecular weight range of 50,000-150,000 Daltons"
  claim_11:
    type: "New dependent claim"
    content: "The composition of claim 1, wherein biodegradation occurs within 180 days in marine environment per ASTM D6691"

arguments:
  enablement:
    - "Specification provides 15 working examples"
    - "Table 3 shows biodegradation data for various environments"
    - "Prophetic examples properly enabled per MPEP 2164.02"
  obviousness:
    - "Thompson teaches different polymer backbone (PLA vs our PHA)"
    - "Garcia requires toxic catalyst incompatible with biodegradation"
    - "Unexpected 73% faster degradation rate (see Declaration)"

evidence_submitted:
  - "Declaration of Dr. Elena Vasquez with test data"
  - "Comparative testing results (Exhibit A)"
  - "ASTM D6691 marine biodegradation data (Exhibit B)"

interview_request: true
proposed_examiner_amendment: "Willing to discuss dependent claims 15-20"
