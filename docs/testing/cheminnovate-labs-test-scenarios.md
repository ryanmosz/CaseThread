## Testing Objectives

Each scenario tests different aspects:

1. **Patent Assignment**: Complex consideration structure, inventor relations
2. **Patent License**: Field of use exclusivity, performance obligations
3. **Office Action Response**: Technical argumentation, claim amendments
4. **Provisional Patent**: Urgent timeline, comprehensive disclosure
5. **Cease & Desist**: Trademark enforcement, technical products
6. **Technology Transfer**: Know-how transfer, manufacturing scale-up

## Expected Results

The system should:
- Maintain Sarah Chen's formal, technical, numbered-section style
- Include appropriate technical depth for chemical inventions
- Reference prior documents (assignment before license)
- Balance legal protection with business relationships
- Demonstrate understanding of patent prosecution

## Additional Notes

- All documents reference appropriate matter numbers
