# Multi-Agent Integration Testing Plan

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- **Multi-agent integration** merged successfully from PR #1
- **All 8 document types** generate successfully with multi-agent pipeline
- **Error handling** tests show system resilience (ChromaDB can be down)
- **Backward compatibility** maintained (container names, existing tests)
- **ChromaDB integration** working with proper Docker networking
- **Unit tests** all passing (266 tests)
- **Average generation time**: 33 seconds per document

### ❌ Issues Found
- **Test coverage**: 65.77% (below 80% target)
- **Command coverage**: 0% for generate.ts and learn.ts  
- **New service coverage**: 0% for embeddings.ts and indexer.ts
- **Error messages**: Too generic (need more specific error handling)

## Test Coverage Breakdown

### Files with 0% Coverage
1. **src/commands/generate.ts** - Main CLI command
2. **src/commands/learn.ts** - New learn command  
3. **src/services/embeddings.ts** - OpenAI embeddings service
4. **src/services/indexer.ts** - Document indexing service

### Files with Low Coverage
1. **src/agents/ContextBuilderAgent.ts** - 43.33% coverage
2. **src/index.ts** - 56.25% coverage

## Testing Requirements

### 1. Integration Tests for Commands
- Create integration tests that actually run the CLI commands
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external services (OpenAI, ChromaDB) for unit tests

### 2. Service Tests Needed
- **embeddings.ts**: Test OpenAI embedding generation
- **indexer.ts**: Test document chunking and indexing
- **retriever.ts**: Increase coverage from 83.89%

### 3. Agent Tests Needed  
- **ContextBuilderAgent**: Increase from 43.33% coverage
- Test agent communication and state management
- Test error handling in agent pipeline

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- Full pipeline tests with real ChromaDB
- Performance benchmarks
- Memory usage tests
- Concurrent generation tests

## Action Items

### Immediate (Before Main Merge)
1. [ ] Add integration tests for generate command
2. [ ] Add integration tests for learn command
3. [ ] Mock OpenAI in unit tests for embeddings service
4. [ ] Add basic indexer service tests
5. [ ] Improve error messages for better debugging

### Short Term (Post-Merge)
1. [ ] Comprehensive agent communication tests
2. [ ] Performance optimization testing
3. [ ] Load testing with multiple concurrent requests
4. [ ] ChromaDB persistence tests
5. [ ] Cross-platform compatibility tests

### Long Term
1. [ ] Automated performance regression tests
2. [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline
3. [ ] Automated document quality assessment
4. [ ] A/B testing framework for prompt improvements

## Test Scripts Created

1. **test-all-documents.sh** - Tests all 8 document types
   - Location: `docs/testing/test-scripts/test-all-documents.sh`
   - Updated for Docker execution
   - Tracks timing and success rates

2. **test-error-scenarios.sh** - Tests error handling
   - Location: `docs/testing/test-scripts/test-error-scenarios.sh`
   - Tests invalid inputs, missing files, ChromaDB down
   - 3/5 tests passing (error messages need improvement)

## Next Steps

1. **Increase test coverage to 80%+**
   - Focus on command files first
   - Then new services
   - Finally improve agent coverage

2. **Create PR for main merge**
   - Document all changes
   - Include test results
   - Highlight backward compatibility

3. **Post-merge improvements**
   - Performance optimization
   - Better error messages
   - More comprehensive logging
