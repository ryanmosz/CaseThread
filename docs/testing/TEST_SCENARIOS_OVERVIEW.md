## Common Themes Across Test Suites

### Attorney Style Consistency
Each suite tests the assigned attorney's distinctive style:

**Michael Rodriguez** (Iris Design Studio, Rainbow Tales):
- Accessible, friendly tone
- Visual formatting (bullet points, sections)
- Business-focused approach
- Relationship-building language

**Sarah Chen** (ChemInnovate Labs):
- Formal, technical writing
- Numbered sections and subsections
- Detailed legal analysis
- Scientific precision

### Document Relationships
Each suite includes documents that reference:
- Prior correspondence
- Matter numbers (IDS-2023-TM01, RTP-2023-INF)
- Settlement terms
- Client emotional context

### Progressive Complexity
Documents progress from simple to complex:
1. Initial protective documents (applications, NDAs)
2. Dispute resolution (responses, negotiations)
3. Collaboration agreements
4. Enforcement actions

## Testing Matrix

|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Trademark Application | Amendment (Scenario 1) | New filing (Scenario 2) | N/A |
| NDA | Settlement discussions (Scenario 2) | Mutual for collaboration (Scenario 1) | Included in mock data |

## Expected System Behaviors

### Context Awareness
The system should:
- Recognize ongoing disputes from mock data
- Pull relevant dates and matter numbers
- Reference prior documents appropriately
- Maintain narrative consistency

### Style Adaptation
Documents should reflect:
- Michael's accessible writing style
- Client-appropriate tone (professional yet friendly)
- Consistent formatting preferences
- Appropriate legal formality level

### Business Integration
Generated documents should:
- Include realistic business terms
- Reference actual client circumstances
- Propose practical solutions
- Balance legal protection with relationship building

## Usage Instructions

1. **Individual Testing**: Run each scenario separately to verify specific document generation
2. **Suite Testing**: Run all scenarios for a client to test narrative flow
3. **Cross-Client Testing**: Compare similar documents (e.g., NDAs) across clients
4. **Style Comparison**: Generate same document type with different attorneys (if expanding to Sarah Chen)

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 95%+ of required fields correctly populated
- **Style Match**: Consistent with attorney's voice across documents
- **Context Integration**: Appropriate references to mock data
- **Legal Validity**: Documents contain necessary legal elements
- **Narrative Flow**: Documents tell coherent story when viewed together

## Future Enhancements

1. Add test scenarios for TechFlow Solutions (Sarah Chen's other client)
2. Create cross-attorney collaboration scenarios
3. Test international filing documents (PCT, foreign filing)
4. Add litigation document scenarios
5. Test batch generation with dependencies
6. Create scenarios testing patent-trademark overlap
7. Add trade secret protection scenarios
