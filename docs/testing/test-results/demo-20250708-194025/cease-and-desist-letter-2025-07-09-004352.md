Re: Patent Infringement - Cease and Desist Demand


Dear CacheFlow Systems, Inc.:

This firm represents TechFlow Solutions, Inc. We are writing to demand that you immediately cease and desist from infringing our client's intellectual property rights.


TechFlow Solutions, Inc. owns valuable intellectual property rights in U.S. Patent Application No. 17/234,567, titled “System and Method for Predictive Cache Optimization,” filed on October 20, 2023, with a priority date of April 20, 2023.


We have discovered that you are making, using, offering for sale, and selling the SmartCache Pro product, launched on March 1, 2024, which embodies each and every element of TechFlow Solutions’ patented technology.

Evidence of this infringement is attached as Exhibit A.


Your unauthorized use of our patented technology constitutes patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271. Patent infringement carries significant penalties, including injunctive relief and damages.


Therefore, we demand that you:

1. IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST from all use of our patented technology;  
2. DESTROY all inventory, marketing materials, and other items that infringe our intellectual property;  
3. PROVIDE a full accounting of all sales and profits derived from your infringing activities;  
4. CONTACT US to discuss a possible licensing arrangement if you wish to continue using our intellectual property;  
5. CONFIRM IN WRITING within 14 days that you have complied with these demands.


Failure to comply with these demands will leave us no alternative but to pursue all available legal remedies, including immediate legal action for injunctive relief, damages, profits, and attorneys' fees. Be advised that continued infringement after receipt of this notice constitutes willful infringement, which may result in enhanced damages and attorneys' fees. We are prepared to immediately file suit to protect our client's rights.


This is a serious matter requiring your immediate attention. Govern yourself accordingly. Time is of the essence. This letter is written without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to our client, all of which are expressly reserved.

You must respond within 14 days of the date of this letter.

Sincerely,

Sarah Chen
