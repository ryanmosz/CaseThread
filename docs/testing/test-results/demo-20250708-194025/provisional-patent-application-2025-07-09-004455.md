Title: BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL MULCH FILMS WITH ENHANCED UV STABILITY  
Inventor(s): Dr. Michael Chang; Dr. Sarah Kim  
Filing Date: February 28, 2024  

---

TECHNICAL FIELD
---------------

[0001] The present invention relates generally to biodegradable polymer compositions and, more particularly, to polyhydroxyalkanoate-based (PHA-based) biodegradable mulch films formulated for agricultural applications that exhibit extended ultraviolet (UV) stability during field use followed by rapid, microbially triggered biodegradation in soil.

---

BACKGROUND
----------

[0002] Conventional polyethylene and other petroleum-derived mulch films are widely used in commercial agriculture to suppress weeds, conserve soil moisture, and improve crop yield. However, these films must be manually removed at the end of each growing season, generating significant plastic waste and disposal costs. Mechanical retrieval can damage crops and soil, while incomplete removal leaves fragments that accumulate and negatively impact soil health. Previous attempts to introduce biodegradable films have suffered from insufficient mechanical integrity or premature degradation under prolonged UV exposure, thereby limiting commercial adoption.

---

SUMMARY
-------

[0003] Disclosed herein are biodegradable polymer compositions, and agricultural mulch films fabricated therefrom, comprising a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) matrix blended with 5-10 wt % starch and a novel UV stabilizer package present at 0.5-2 wt %. The formulation, referenced as “Modified BioPoly-X™,” maintains at least 80 % of its initial tensile strength for a minimum continuous field deployment of six (6) months while undergoing complete biodegradation within twelve (12) months after soil incorporation, as measured in accordance with ISO 17556.

[0004] Various embodiments and aspects of the invention will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
--------------------

[0006] The invention provides a biodegradable mulch film that addresses the dual requirements of mechanical durability during a typical crop cycle and reliable, rapid biodegradation thereafter. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are by weight.

1. Polymer Matrix  
   [0007] Suitable PHA resins include poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) having a hydroxyvalerate content of 6-12 mol %. The PHA confers high tensile strength and elongation while remaining fully biodegradable. Optionally, up to 20 % of the PHA may be replaced with polylactic acid (PLA) to tailor stiffness.

2. Starch Component  
   [0008] The starch fraction, preferably corn or potato starch, is incorporated at 5-10 %. Gelatinized starch granules increase microbial accessibility, thereby expediting enzymatic hydrolysis once the film is soil-incorporated.

3. Plasticizer  
   [0009] Triacetin or epoxidized soybean oil is included at 3-5 % to improve processability and film flexibility.

4. UV Stabilizer Package  
   [0010] A synergistic mixture of (a) a benzotriazole UV absorber and (b) a hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) is introduced at a combined loading of 0.5-2 %. The benzotriazole preferentially dissipates UV-B radiation, while the HALS scavenges free radicals generated within the polymer matrix, collectively retarding photodegradation during the crop cycle.

5. Optional Reinforcements  
   [0011] Natural fibers such as kenaf or hemp (1-8 %) may be added to increase tear resistance without compromising biodegradability.

6. Film Fabrication  
   [0012] The compounded blend is extruded through a blown-film line at 150-165 °C, producing films of 15-35 µm thickness. Extrusion temperatures are held below 170 °C to prevent thermal degradation of the PHA backbone.

7. Mechanism of Controlled Degradation  
   [0013] During field deployment, the UV stabilizer package preserves molecular weight, ensuring functional integrity. After tillage, soil microorganisms secrete PHA depolymerases that depolymerize the film into oligomers and monomers, which are subsequently mineralized to CO₂, water, and biomass.

8. Examples  

   Example 1: Base Formulation  
   [0014] 85 % PHBV, 10 % corn starch, 3 % triacetin, and 2 % UV stabilizer package were melt-blended and blown into 25 µm films. Field trials in California strawberry beds demonstrated 82 % retention of tensile strength after six months and 95 % biodegradation within ten months per ISO 17556.

   Example 2: Enhanced Strength Variant  
   [0015] 80 % PHBV, 8 % starch, 7 % kenaf fiber (200 µm average length), 3 % triacetin, and 2 % UV stabilizer were processed into 20 µm films. Tensile strength was 28 MPa with 260 % elongation, suitable for mechanized film-laying equipment.

9. Testing Data  
   [0016] Mechanical properties were measured according to ASTM D882: tensile strength 25 MPa and elongation at break 300 %. ISO 17556 testing confirmed mineralization of 95 % within ten months. Six-month field trials showed intact coverage with no significant loss of tensile strength or embrittlement.

10. Variations  
   [0017] One skilled in the art will recognize that the starch source, plasticizer type, and UV stabilizer ratios may be adjusted without departing from the scope of the invention. All such modifications and equivalents are intended to be encompassed by the appended claims.

[0018] While specific embodiments have been described, they are illustrative rather than limiting, and many variations and modifications are possible. The scope of the invention is defined only by the claims that may subsequently be submitted in a non-provisional application claiming priority to this provisional filing.

ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION
---------------------------

[0007] The present invention provides several technical advantages over existing solutions:

• Eliminates persistent plastic waste in agricultural fields through complete biodegradation.  
• Removes the need for costly and labor-intensive film retrieval operations.  
• Produces degradation byproducts that can enhance soil organic matter and microbiome.  
• Offers mechanical properties and cost competitiveness comparable to conventional polyethylene mulch films.
