In re Application of: Dr. Lisa Wang et al.  
Application No.: 17/234,567

For: System and Method for Predictive Cache Optimization in Distributed Computing Environments Using Machine Learning  
Examiner: Thomas Chen  
Art Unit: 2142  

# RESPONSE TO OFFICE ACTION



## Section 1: Introduction  

Commissioner for Patents  
P.O. Box 1450  
Alexandria, VA 22313-1450  

Dear Sir:  

In response to the Office Action mailed January 20, 2024, please consider the following amendments and remarks.



## Section 2: Amendments to the Claims  

### AMENDMENTS TO THE CLAIMS  

Please amend the claims as follows (additions underlined, deletions in [brackets]):

**Claim 1 (Currently Amended)**  

1. (Amended) A distributed computing system comprising:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a plurality of cache nodes configured to store data objects for client requests;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**at least one _graphics processing unit (GPU)_ operatively coupled to the cache nodes and capable of performing not less than _10⁹ matrix-multiplication operations per second_;**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_remote direct memory access (RDMA) network controllers_ configured to provide zero-copy data transfers between the cache nodes;**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a predictive cache-optimization module including **an _LSTM neural network having a 128-256-128-64 neuron architecture_** trained to forecast future cache requests; and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein execution of the predictive cache-optimization module on the GPU causes the distributed computing system to achieve **a cache-hit rate of at least _94 percent_ and an end-to-end network latency of less than _50 milliseconds_.**



## Section 3: Status of Claims  

### STATUS OF THE CLAIMS  

Claims 1-20 were rejected in the Office Action.  
Claims 1 has been amended.  
No claims have been cancelled.  
No new claims have been added.  
Claims 1-20 are currently pending.



## Section 4: Response to Rejections  

### RESPONSE TO REJECTIONS  

#### I. Response to 35 U.S.C. § 101 Rejection  

Claims 1-20 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as allegedly directed to an abstract idea involving mental processes and mathematical concepts.  

Applicant respectfully traverses this rejection. As set forth below, the amended claims recite (i) a specific, concrete hardware configuration, and (ii) an improvement in the functioning of the computer system itself, thereby satisfying both Steps 2A and 2B of the USPTO’s subject-matter-eligibility guidance.



## Section 5: Detailed Arguments  

### REMARKS  

1. **Claims Recite a Practical Application (Step 2A, Prong 2).**  
   • The amended claims require execution of the predictive cache-optimization module on a _GPU_ and data movement over _RDMA controllers_. These concrete hardware elements are not generic processors but specialized components that facilitate high-throughput, low-latency data handling.  
   • The claims further require quantitative performance thresholds—a cache-hit rate ≥ 94 % and latency < 50 ms—that anchor the invention in the physical-realm operation of a distributed system.  

2. **Significant Technical Improvement Over the Prior Art.**  
   • The industry has long faced a need to mitigate network latency exceeding 100 ms in large-scale clusters. Benchmark evidence of record shows the claimed configuration reduces latency by 47 ms while increasing cache-hit rate to 94 %. No cited reference achieves comparable results.  
   • The LSTM architecture (128-256-128-64) is specifically adapted to temporal access-patterns in distributed caches and is materially different from generic ML models cited in the Office Action.  

3. **Inventive Concept (Step 2B).**  
   • The combination of (i) the novel LSTM configuration, (ii) modified Raft-based coherency protocol, and (iii) RDMA-enabled data paths constitutes an unconventional arrangement of components that is not routine, well-understood, or conventional.  
   • Performance data, the Declaration of Dr. Lisa Wang, and independent commercial success (e.g., CloudGiant license valued at \$500 k) provide objective evidence of non-obviousness and eligibility.  

4. **Secondary Considerations Reinforce Patentability.**  
   • _Commercial Success_: Rapid market adoption and Series B funding highlight the invention’s value.  
   • _Long-Felt Need & Failure of Others_: Major cloud providers have attempted but failed to attain sub-50 ms latency with existing cache systems.  
   • _Unexpected Results_: The measured 40 % improvement over theoretical predictions demonstrates the system’s surprising efficacy.  

5. **Procedural Matters.**  
   • Should the Examiner find any additional issues outstanding, Applicant respectfully requests a telephone interview to expedite resolution and stands ready to provide a live system demonstration.



## Section 6: Conclusion  

### CONCLUSION  

In view of the foregoing amendments and remarks, Applicant respectfully submits that all claims are in condition for allowance. Applicant believes that no outstanding issues remain, and respectfully requests that the Examiner indicate allowance of the application at the earliest convenience.  

If the Examiner believes that a telephone interview would expedite prosecution of this application, the Examiner is invited to contact the undersigned at the telephone number provided below.
