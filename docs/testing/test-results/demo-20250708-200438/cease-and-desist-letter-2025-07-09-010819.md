Dear CacheFlow Systems, Inc.:

This firm represents TechFlow Solutions, Inc. We are writing to demand that you immediately cease and desist from infringing our client's intellectual property rights.

TechFlow Solutions, Inc. owns valuable intellectual property rights in its patented “System and Method for Predictive Cache Optimization,” U.S. Patent Application No. 17/234,567 (the “Patent”).

We have discovered that you are making, using, offering for sale, selling, and/or importing the “SmartCache Pro” product launched on or about March 1, 2024, which practices multiple patented elements, including but not limited to:  
• LSTM neural network prediction (claims 1, 8, 15)  
• Dynamic window sizing between 5–60 minutes (claims 3, 10)  
• Modified consensus protocol embodied in your “TurboSync” feature (claims 6, 13)  

Evidence of this infringement is attached as Exhibit A.

Your unauthorized use of our patented technology constitutes patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271. Patent infringement carries significant penalties, including injunctive relief and damages.

Therefore, we demand that you:

1. IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST from all use of our patented technology;  
2. DESTROY all inventory, marketing materials, and other items that infringe our intellectual property;  
3. PROVIDE a full accounting of all sales and profits derived from your infringing activities;  
4. CONTACT US to discuss a possible licensing arrangement if you wish to continue using our intellectual property;  
5. CONFIRM IN WRITING within 14 days that you have complied with these demands.

If you fail to comply with these demands, we will have no choice but to consider all available legal remedies, including filing a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. Failure to comply with these demands will leave us no alternative but to pursue all available legal remedies, including immediate legal action for injunctive relief, damages, profits, and attorneys’ fees.

We await your prompt response and compliance with these demands. This is a serious matter requiring your immediate attention. Govern yourself accordingly.

You must respond within 14 days of the date of this letter.

Sincerely,
