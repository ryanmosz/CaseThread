Title: BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL MULCH FILMS WITH ENHANCED UV STABILITY  
Inventor(s): Dr. Michael Chang; Dr. Sarah Kim  
Filing Date: February 28, 2024  

---

TECHNICAL FIELD
---------------

[0001] The present invention relates generally to biodegradable polymer compositions, and more particularly to polyhydroxyalkanoate-based (PHA-based) blends formulated for use in agricultural mulch films that exhibit enhanced ultraviolet (UV) stability while maintaining controlled, microbially triggered biodegradation in soil environments.

---

BACKGROUND
----------

[0002] Conventional polyethylene or polypropylene mulch films are widely employed to suppress weeds, conserve moisture, and regulate soil temperature in commercial agriculture. However, these petro-derived plastics persist in the environment long after crop cycles end, requiring costly mechanical retrieval and disposal. Residual fragments contribute to soil contamination, increase landfill burden, and create regulatory compliance challenges for growers. Existing biodegradable alternatives often suffer from insufficient mechanical integrity under prolonged field exposure, particularly under high-intensity UV radiation, resulting in premature failure before crop harvest.

---

SUMMARY
-------

[0003] The present invention provides biodegradable polymer compositions designated herein as Modified BioPoly-X™ formulations. The compositions comprise a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) matrix blended with 5–10 wt % starch, 0.5–2 wt % of a novel UV stabilizer package, and optional natural fiber and plasticizer constituents. The UV stabilizer package synergistically interacts with the PHA backbone to preserve at least 80 % of the film’s initial tensile strength for a minimum of six months of outdoor exposure while remaining fully home-compostable.

[0004] Various embodiments and aspects of the invention will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
--------------------

[0006] Unless defined otherwise, all percentages are by weight. The term “mulch film” refers to a thin, flexible sheet ranging from 10 µm to 50 µm in thickness, suitable for placement on agricultural soil.

1. Composition  

   a. Base Polymer – 75–90 wt % polyhydroxyalkanoate having a 3-hydroxybutyrate to 3-hydroxyvalerate molar ratio of 90:10 to 70:30.  

   b. Starch Component – 5–10 wt % thermoplastic corn starch, pre-plasticized with 10 wt % glycerol relative to starch content, enhancing film elongation.  

   c. UV Stabilizer Package – 0.5–2 wt % blend of (i) hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) and (ii) lignin-derived phenolic antioxidant, each present at a ratio of 3:1 to 1:1.  

   d. Optional Natural Fiber – 0–10 wt % cellulose or hemp micro-fibers (length <250 µm) for modulus enhancement.  

   e. Plasticizer – 2–5 wt % citrate ester to improve processability and low-temperature flexibility.  

2. Manufacturing Method  

   (i) The dry components are fed into a twin-screw extruder maintained at 140–165 °C with a screw speed of 150–250 rpm.  
   (ii) A vacuum vent zone removes volatiles, reducing moisture to <0.05 wt %.  
   (iii) The compounded melt is pelletized and subsequently cast or blown into films using conventional film-blowing equipment with a blow-up ratio of 2.5:1.  

3. Functional Performance  

   • Mechanical Properties – As produced, the film exhibits tensile strength of 25 MPa and elongation at break of 300 %. After six months of field exposure, retained tensile strength remains ≥80 % of initial.  
   • UV Resistance – Q-SUN xenon-arc testing (ASTM G155, Cycle 1) demonstrates color change ΔE <2 and no significant embrittlement after 1,000 hours.  
   • Biodegradation – ISO 17556 soil burial tests show 95 % mass loss within ten months, satisfying “complete biodegradation” criteria within a 12-month target window.  

4. Exemplary Formulations  

   Example 1 (Base Formulation): 85 % PHA, 10 % corn starch, 3 % citrate plasticizer, 2 % UV stabilizer.  

   Example 2 (Enhanced Strength Variant): 80 % PHA, 8 % starch, 7 % natural fiber, 3 % plasticizer, 2 % UV stabilizer.

5. Application Method  

   Films are installed using standard mechanical mulch layers. At the conclusion of the crop cycle, films are disk-integrated into the top 15 cm of soil, where indigenous soil microbiota initiate depolymerization of the PHA matrix, followed by assimilation of degradation products, thereby eliminating removal labor.

ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION
---------------------------

[0007] The present invention provides several technical advantages over existing solutions:  

• Eliminates persistent plastic waste in agricultural fields through complete biodegradation.  
• Removes the need for labor-intensive retrieval and disposal of spent mulch films.  
• Releases nutrient-rich byproducts that can enhance soil health and microbial activity.  
• Offers field longevity (≥6 months) comparable to conventional polyethylene films under high-UV conditions.  
• Maintains cost competitiveness by utilizing commercially available PHA and starch feedstocks.

------

What is claimed is:

1. A biodegradable polymer composition for agricultural mulch films comprising:  
   (a) 75 wt % to 90 wt % polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA);  
   (b) 5 wt % to 10 wt % thermoplastic starch;  
   (c) 0.5 wt % to 2 wt % UV stabilizer package comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a lignin-derived phenolic antioxidant; and  
   (d) 2 wt % to 5 wt % plasticizer,

2. The biodegradable polymer composition of claim 1, wherein the PHA has a 3-hydroxybutyrate to 3-hydroxyvalerate molar ratio between 90:10 and 70:30.

3. The biodegradable polymer composition of claim 1, further comprising 1 wt % to 10 wt % natural cellulose or hemp fibers to enhance mechanical modulus.

4. A mulch film produced from the composition of any of claims 1–3, having a thickness of 10 µm to 50 µm and manufactured by film blowing.

5. A method of reducing agricultural plastic waste comprising applying the mulch film of claim 4 to crop beds, cultivating crops for at least one growing season, and thereafter incorporating the film into the soil to permit microbial biodegradation.

ABSTRACT
--------

A biodegradable polymer composition for agricultural mulch films is disclosed. The composition includes 75–90 wt % polyhydroxyalkanoate, 5–10 wt % starch, 0.5–2 wt % of a synergistic UV stabilizer package, and optional fibers and plasticizer. The formulation preserves at least 80 % tensile strength during a six-month field service life under high-UV exposure and undergoes at least 90 % biodegradation within twelve months pursuant to ISO 17556 soil burial testing. Films manufactured from the composition can be tilled directly into soil after crop harvest, eliminating retrieval labor and plastic waste while improving soil health.
