Title: BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER COMPOSITIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL MULCH FILMS WITH ENHANCED UV STABILITY

Inventor(s): Dr. Michael Chang; Dr. Sarah Kim

Filing Date: February 28, 2024  


TECHNICAL FIELD
---------------

[0001] The present invention relates to the field of biodegradable polymeric materials, and more particularly to biodegradable polymer compositions formulated for use in agricultural mulch films that exhibit enhanced ultraviolet (UV) stability while maintaining desirable mechanical properties during a defined field-use period prior to controlled biodegradation.


BACKGROUND
----------

[0002] Conventional polyethylene and polypropylene mulch films are widely employed in modern agriculture to conserve soil moisture, suppress weed growth, and moderate soil temperature. However, these petroleum-based plastics persist in the environment, necessitating costly retrieval and disposal after each growing season. Residual fragments left in the soil contribute to microplastic contamination and pose long-term ecological risks. There therefore exists a need for mulch films that perform comparably to conventional plastics during crop cultivation yet fully biodegrade in situ, eliminating removal labor and environmental waste.


SUMMARY
-------

[0003] The invention provides biodegradable polymer compositions, and articles formed therefrom, suitable for agricultural mulch films that (i) retain at least about 80 % of initial tensile strength for a period of approximately six months under typical field conditions and (ii) undergo substantially complete biodegradation in soil within twelve months, as determined in accordance with ISO 17556. The compositions comprise a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) matrix blended with 5–10 wt % starch and a synergistic UV-stabilizer package present in an amount of 0.5–2 wt %. Optionally, natural fibers and plasticizers may be incorporated to tailor mechanical properties.

[0004] Various embodiments and aspects of the invention will be described with reference to details discussed below, and the accompanying drawings will illustrate the various embodiments.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION
--------------------

[0006] The following detailed description is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention and sets forth the best mode presently contemplated by the inventors. It is not intended to limit the scope of the invention, which is defined by the appended claims.

I.  Composition

1. Base Polymer Matrix  
   a. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is employed as the primary biodegradable polymer, present in an amount of about 75–90 wt %. Commercially available PHA grades having a melt flow index (190 °C/2.16 kg) of 3–10 g/10 min are preferred to facilitate film extrusion.  
   b. Thermoplastic starch (TPS) is blended in an amount of about 5–10 wt % to accelerate microbial assimilation after the prescribed service life.

2. Additive Package  
   a. UV Stabilizer System: A proprietary blend of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) and benzotriazole UV absorbers is incorporated at 0.5–2 wt %. The combination mitigates photodegradation of PHA backbones, thereby preserving tensile strength for at least six months of field exposure (≈ 1 MJ m⁻² cumulative UV dosage).  
   b. Plasticizer: A bio-based citrate plasticizer (1–5 wt %) lowers glass-transition temperature, improving flexibility during film deployment.  
   c. Optional Natural Fibers: 2–10 wt % finely milled kenaf or hemp fibers may be added to enhance tear resistance without materially affecting biodegradation kinetics.

II.  Manufacturing Method

Step 1: Dry-blend PHA pellets, starch granules, and additives in a tumble mixer to achieve homogeneous dispersion.  
Step 2: Compound the mixture in a twin-screw extruder operated at 140–160 °C with a screw speed of 200–300 rpm; maintain residence time below 2 minutes to minimize thermal degradation.  
Step 3: Pelletize the compounded strand and dry to < 0.2 % moisture.  
Step 4: Extrude the pellets through a blown-film die to produce mulch film having a thickness of 20–35 µm and a width of 0.9–1.2 m. Typical blow-up ratio is 2.5:1.

III.  Performance Characteristics

• Initial tensile strength (ASTM D882): ≥ 25 MPa; elongation at break: ≥ 300 %.  
• UV-aged tensile retention (6 months, open field): ≥ 80 % of initial value.  
• Biodegradation (ISO 17556, 58 °C composting): ≥ 95 % carbon conversion within 10 months; < 2 % residual microplastics (≤ 500 µm).  
• Soil toxicity: No statistically significant adverse effect on earthworm survival or lettuce germination in accordance with OECD 207 and OECD 208 tests.

IV.  Examples

Example 1: Base Formulation  
• 85 wt % PHA, 10 wt % corn starch, 3 wt % citrate plasticizer, 2 wt % UV stabilizer.  
Field trials in California strawberry beds demonstrated adequate weed suppression and film integrity for the entire growing season.

Example 2: Enhanced Strength Variant  
• 80 wt % PHA, 8 wt % corn starch, 7 wt % kenaf fiber, 3 wt % plasticizer, 2 wt % UV stabilizer.  
The presence of natural fiber increased tear resistance by 20 % relative to Example 1, facilitating mechanical laying operations on uneven terrain.

V.  Testing Data

Field Trials: Conducted over six months in coastal California under average daily UV index of 6. After 180 days, retained tensile strength was 82 % (Example 1) and 85 % (Example 2).  
Laboratory Biodegradation: ISO 17556 testing revealed 95 % biodegradation of Example 1 in 10 months and 92 % of Example 2 in 11 months.  
Mechanical Properties: As-extruded films exhibited tensile strength of 25 MPa and elongation of 300 %, meeting commercial mulch specifications.

VI.  Implementation Considerations

Mulch films prepared according to the invention may be colored with carbon-black-free brown pigments to optimize soil warming while permitting spectral transmission conducive to beneficial microbial activity. Films may be formulated for compatibility with standard plastic laying equipment without modification.

VII.  Disclaimer

The foregoing description of specific embodiments is illustrative and not limiting. Modifications, substitutions, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. No admission is made that any reference constitutes prior art.


ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION
---------------------------

[0007] The present invention provides several technical advantages over existing solutions:

• Eliminates persistent plastic waste in agricultural fields, as the film biodegrades in situ.  
• Removes the need for post-harvest retrieval and disposal labor, reducing operational costs.  
• Generates biodegradation by-products that enhance soil organic matter and microbial activity.  
• Achieves cost parity with conventional polyethylene films through optimized PHA/starch blends and low additive loading.

------

What is claimed is:

1. A biodegradable polymer composition for fabrication into agricultural mulch films, the composition comprising:  
   (a) 75–90 wt % polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA);

   (c) 0.5–2 wt % UV-stabilizer package comprising a hindered amine light stabilizer and a benzotriazole UV absorber,  
wherein a film produced from the composition retains at least 80 % of its initial tensile strength after six months of outdoor field exposure and exhibits ≥ 90 % biodegradation in soil within twelve months in accordance with ISO 17556.

2. The composition of claim 1 further comprising 1–5 wt % bio-based plasticizer selected from citrate esters.

3. The composition of claim 1 or 2 wherein the PHA has a melt flow index of 3–10 g/10 min measured at 190 °C/2.16 kg.

A biodegradable polymer composition and mulch film are disclosed. The composition includes 75–90 wt % polyhydroxyalkanoate, 5–10 wt % starch, and 0.5–2 wt % of a synergistic UV-stabilizer package. Films produced therefrom maintain at least 80 % of initial tensile strength over a six-month cultivation period and undergo at least 90 % biodegradation in soil within twelve months (ISO 17556). Optional plasticizers and natural fibers may be incorporated to tailor mechanical properties. The invention eliminates post-harvest film removal, reduces environmental plastic accumulation, and provides a cost-competitive alternative to conventional polyethylene mulch films.
