In re Application of: Dr. Lisa Wang  
Application No.: 17/234,567

For: System and Method for Predictive Cache Optimization in Distributed Computing Environments Using Machine Learning  
Examiner: Thomas Chen  
Art Unit: 2142  

RESPONSE TO OFFICE ACTION
___

Commissioner for Patents  
P.O. Box 1450  
Alexandria, VA 22313-1450  

Dear Sir:  

In response to the Office Action mailed January 20, 2024, please consider the following amendments and remarks.
___
AMENDMENTS TO THE CLAIMS  

Please amend the claims as follows (additions **underlined**, deletions in [brackets]):

Claim 1 (Currently Amended)  
1. A system for predictive cache optimization in a distributed computing environment, comprising:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a plurality of computing nodes each having a cache memory;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[one or more processors configured to execute instructions to] **at least one central processing unit (CPU) and a graphics processing unit (GPU) configured to execute at least 10^9 operations per second;**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**a remote direct memory access (RDMA) network interface controller coupled to each of the computing nodes;**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an adaptive neural network configured to generate cache-fill predictions, the adaptive neural network including **a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) architecture having 128-256-128-64 neurons; and**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;executing, by the GPU, matrix operations to produce a cache-fill prediction for a corresponding computing node,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein the cache-fill prediction is used to pre-fetch data into the cache memory of the corresponding computing node **when a performance threshold of at least a 94 % cache hit rate and an average network latency below 60 ms is maintained across the distributed computing environment.**

RESPONSE TO REJECTIONS  

I. Response to 35 U.S.C. § 101 Rejection  

Claims 1-20 were rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 101 as being directed to an abstract idea (mental processes and mathematical concepts) without reciting significantly more. Applicant respectfully traverses this rejection for the reasons set forth below and in the accompanying REMARKS section. The amendments to Claim 1 expressly recite concrete, technical hardware (GPU, RDMA NIC, performance thresholds) that integrate the alleged abstract idea into a practical application, thereby providing an inventive concept that transforms the claimed subject matter into patent-eligible technology.
___
REMARKS  

Issue  
The Office Action asserts that the claims are directed to abstract mental processes involving mathematical concepts and thus fail Alice Step 2A. It further contends that the claims lack an inventive concept under Alice Step 2B.

Rule  
Under Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank, 573 U.S. 208 (2014) and the January 2019 PEG, a claim is patent-eligible when it (i) is not directed to an abstract idea, or (ii) recites additional elements that integrate the judicial exception into a practical application, or (iii) provides an inventive concept.

Application  

1. The Claims Are Not Directed Solely to an Abstract Idea  
• The amended claims now expressly require specialized hardware—including GPUs capable of ≥10^9 operations per second and RDMA network controllers—that perform real-time matrix operations unattainable by a generic computer.  
• The LSTM architecture (128-256-128-64 neurons) is specifically configured to predict cache-fill operations within sub-50 ms, directly addressing a technological problem (network latency >100 ms) in distributed systems.  
• These limitations tether the claims to a concrete technological environment and thus fall squarely within the “improvements to computer technology” exemption recognized in Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft, 822 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

2. Practical Application—Integration of the Alleged Abstract Idea  
• The requirement that the system maintain a ≥94 % cache hit rate and <60 ms latency constitutes a real-world performance constraint, demonstrating a practical application rather than a mere mathematical exercise.  
• The claims improve the functioning of the computer itself by reducing inter-node traffic and latency, analogous to the improvements found eligible in DDR Holdings v. Hotels.com, 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

3. Inventive Concept—Significantly More Than the Alleged Abstract Idea  
• The combination of (i) a novel multi-layer LSTM architecture, (ii) dynamic window sizing within a modified Raft protocol for cache coherency, and (iii) RDMA hardware integration was neither taught nor suggested by the prior art.  
• Performance benchmarks (see Dr. Wang Declaration) show a 47 ms latency reduction—40 % better than theoretical predictions—constituting unexpected results that evidence non-obviousness and an inventive concept.  
• Commercial success evidenced by CloudGiant’s $500 K license and the SIGCOMM 2023 Best Paper Award further support eligibility under Step 2B.

4. Secondary Considerations Underscore Patentability  
• Long-felt need: Industry has struggled for over a decade with distributed cache latency.  
• Failure of others: Major cloud providers have attempted and failed to achieve comparable performance.  
• Unexpected results: 40 % improvement over theoretical limits demonstrates the solution exceeds routine optimization.

Conclusion  
Accordingly, the claims, as amended, (i) are not directed to a judicial exception, (ii) integrate any alleged abstract idea into a practical application, and (iii) recite significantly more, thereby satisfying 35 U.S.C. § 101.
___
CONCLUSION  

In view of the foregoing amendments and remarks, Applicant respectfully submits that all claims are in condition for allowance. Applicant believes that no outstanding issues remain, and respectfully requests that the Examiner indicate allowance of the application at the earliest convenience.

If the Examiner believes that a telephone interview would expedite prosecution of this application, the Examiner is invited to contact the undersigned at the telephone number provided below.
