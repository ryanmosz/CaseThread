Re: Patent Infringement - Cease and Desist Demand


Dear CacheFlow Systems, Inc.:

We represent TechFlow Solutions, Inc. in connection with their intellectual property rights.  


TechFlow Solutions, Inc. owns valuable intellectual property rights in a patented system and method for predictive cache optimization, embodied in U.S. Patent Application No. 17/234,567, titled “System and Method for Predictive Cache Optimization.”  


We have discovered that you are marketing, selling, and offering for sale the “SmartCache Pro” product, launched on March 1, 2024, which incorporates technology covered by our client’s patent claims, including but not limited to:

• LSTM neural network prediction (claims 1, 8, 15)  
• Dynamic window sizing between 5–60 minutes (claims 3, 10)  
• Modified consensus protocol implemented as your “TurboSync” feature (claims 6, 13)  

Evidence of this infringement is attached as Exhibit A.  


Your unauthorized use of our patented technology constitutes patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271. Patent infringement carries significant penalties, including injunctive relief and damages.  


Therefore, we demand that you:

1. IMMEDIATELY CEASE AND DESIST from all use of our patented technology;  
2. PROVIDE a full accounting of all sales and profits derived from your infringing activities;  
3. CONTACT US to discuss a possible licensing arrangement if you wish to continue using our intellectual property;  
4. CONFIRM IN WRITING within 14 days that you have complied with these demands.  


If you fail to comply with these demands, we will have no choice but to consider all available legal remedies, including filing a lawsuit seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees.
