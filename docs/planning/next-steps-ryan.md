# Next Steps for Ryan

## üéØ Development Context
We're starting with a **CLI-first approach**. All initial features will be command-line based, with the GUI coming later in Phase 2. Keep this in mind when researching and creating templates/data.

## üìã Your Tasks

### 1. Make List of Templates for IP Attorneys

Create a comprehensive list of document templates that IP attorneys use regularly. Focus on the most common and time-consuming documents.

**Research:**
- Patent applications (provisional, non-provisional, PCT)
- Trademark applications and responses
- Licensing agreements
- NDAs and confidentiality agreements
- Assignment agreements
- Office action responses
- IP due diligence checklists

**Deliverable:** 
- Markdown file with categorized template list
- Priority ranking (which to implement first)
- Notes on complexity and common variations
- Sample structure for top 3 templates
- **CLI considerations:** How each template would work via command-line

**Resources:**
- USPTO website for standard forms
- IP law firm websites for template examples
- Legal form libraries (public access ones)

### 2. Investigate Database Integration

Research and recommend the best approach for integrating databases with our CLI tool (GUI integration will come later).

**Key Questions:**
- How to integrate SQLite with Node.js CLI apps?
- Best practices for local database encryption
- How to handle database migrations in CLI context
- Backup/restore functionality via commands
- Performance considerations for document storage

**Technical Investigation:**
- Test `better-sqlite3` vs `node-sqlite3`
- Evaluate `electron-store` for simple key-value needs
- Look into `typeorm` or `prisma` for ORM
- Consider vector database options for embeddings (`vectra`, `chromadb`)
- **CLI focus:** Database operations must work from command line

**Deliverable:**
- Technical recommendation document
- Proof of concept code for basic CRUD operations via CLI
- Performance benchmarks
- Security considerations
- Migration strategy for CLI users

### 3. Make Mock Law Firm Data

Create realistic mock data representing a small IP law firm's document history. This data will be used to test CLI commands.

**Mock Firm Profile:**
- Name: "Peninsula IP Partners"
- Size: 5-attorney boutique firm
- Focus: Software patents and tech licensing
- Style: Formal but accessible

**Data to Create:**
- 10-15 sample patent applications (varied technical fields)
- 5-7 licensing agreements with different terms
- 3-5 trademark applications
- Various NDAs and assignments
- Include firm-specific language patterns and preferences

**Format:**
- Plain text files organized by document type
- Metadata JSON for each document (date, attorney, client industry)
- README explaining the firm's "style guide"
- **CLI testing:** Structure data for easy CLI ingestion

**Important:** 
- Use only public domain content or create original
- Anonymize any real names/companies
- Include common firm-specific phrases and formatting
- Consider how CLI commands will process this data

## üéØ Priority Order

1. **First:** Template list (helps scope the CLI commands)
2. **Second:** Mock data (needed for CLI testing)
3. **Third:** Database integration (foundation for CLI data persistence)

## üìÖ Timeline

Aim to complete all three tasks within the next week:
- **Day 1-2:** Template research and list
- **Day 3-4:** Mock data creation
- **Day 5-7:** Database investigation

## üí° Tips

- For templates, think about CLI-friendly formats (JSON, YAML, Markdown)
- Mock data should be easily processable via command-line tools
- Database integration should prioritize CLI performance
- Consider how users will interact via terminal commands

## ü§ù Collaboration

- Share progress in daily standups
- Create draft PRs early for feedback
- Document findings in the planning folder
- Ask questions if anything is unclear
