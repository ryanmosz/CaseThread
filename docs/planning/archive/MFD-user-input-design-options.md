# User Input Design Options for Document Generation

## Current State
- CLI takes YAML files with structured data
- Templates expect specific fields
- No GUI exists yet
- Multi-agent system processes the input

## Decision Criteria for MVP
1. **Simplicity of development** (most important)
2. **Demo-ability** 
3. **Straight path from current implementation**
4. **Time to implement** (we have until Friday)

## Option 1: Direct YAML Upload

### Description
- User uploads YAML file through file picker
- Display generated document
- Essentially a GUI wrapper around current CLI

### Development Complexity: ⭐ (1/5 - Easiest)
- **Implementation**: 2-3 hours
- **Changes needed**: 
  - File upload component
  - Call existing CLI functionality
  - Display result
- **Reuses**: Everything - just adds GUI layer

### Pros
- Almost no backend changes
- Can demo all 8 document types immediately
- Fail-safe option

### Cons
- Not user-friendly for demo
- Requires pre-made YAML files

## Option 2: Basic Form Interface

### Description
- Simple form with text inputs for each field
- One form per document type
- Generate button submits data

### Development Complexity: ⭐⭐ (2/5 - Easy)
- **Implementation**: 4-6 hours
- **Changes needed**:
  - Create form components
  - Map form fields to YAML structure
  - Basic validation
- **Reuses**: All backend logic

### Pros
- Straightforward to implement
- Clear what's needed
- Good for demo

### Cons
- Need to build 8 different forms
- Not innovative for demo

---

## Option 3: Single Dynamic Form

### Description
- One smart form that adapts based on document type selection
- Dropdown to choose document type
- Form fields change based on selection

### Development Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5 - Moderate)
- **Implementation**: 6-8 hours
- **Changes needed**:
  - Dynamic form generator
  - Field configuration system
  - State management for form
- **Reuses**: Backend unchanged

### Pros
- More impressive for demo
- Single component to maintain
- Professional appearance

### Cons
- More complex state management
- Needs careful planning

---

## Option 4: Conversational Chat Interface

### Description
- Chat window where user describes needs
- AI extracts required information
- Generates document from conversation

### Development Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - Complex)
- **Implementation**: 10-15 hours
- **Changes needed**:
  - Chat UI component
  - Natural language processing
  - Information extraction logic
  - Conversation state management
- **New development**: Significant

### Pros
- Very impressive for demo
- Shows AI capabilities
- Natural interaction

### Cons
- Significant new development
- Risk of extraction errors
- May not complete by Friday

---

## Option 5: Hybrid (Chat + Form Review)

### Description
- Chat captures initial info
- Populates form for review
- User confirms before generation

### Development Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5 - Most Complex)
- **Implementation**: 15-20 hours
- **Changes needed**:
  - Everything from Option 4
  - Plus form generation
  - Data mapping layer
- **New development**: Extensive

### Pros
- Best of both worlds
- Most impressive

### Cons
- Too complex for Friday deadline
- High risk of incomplete demo

---

## Option 6: Template Preview with Inline Edit

### Description
- Show document template
- Click placeholders to fill in
- Visual editing experience

### Development Complexity: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 - Complex)
- **Implementation**: 12-15 hours
- **Changes needed**:
  - Template renderer
  - Inline editing components
  - Placeholder detection
- **New development**: Significant

### Pros
- Very visual
- Clear where info goes

### Cons
- Complex to implement
- Need template parser

---

## Recommendation for MVP

### Primary: Option 2 (Basic Form Interface)
- **Why**: Fastest path to working demo
- **Timeline**: Can complete by Wednesday
- **Risk**: Very low

### Backup: Option 1 (YAML Upload)
- **Why**: Guaranteed to work
- **Timeline**: Few hours
- **Risk**: Zero

### If Time Permits: Upgrade to Option 3 (Dynamic Form)
- **Why**: More impressive but still achievable
- **Timeline**: Thursday addition
- **Risk**: Low to moderate

## Implementation Plan

### Day 1 (Tuesday)
1. Implement Option 1 as safety net
2. Start Option 2 forms

### Day 2 (Wednesday)  
1. Complete Option 2
2. Test all document types
3. Assess time for Option 3

### Day 3 (Thursday)
1. Polish Option 2 or upgrade to Option 3
2. Integration testing
3. Demo preparation

### Demo Strategy
- Start with: "We've built a flexible input system"
- Show 2-3 document types
- Emphasize speed of generation
- Focus on output quality, not input method

## Post-MVP Considerations
After Friday, consider developing Option 4 (Chat) or Option 5 (Hybrid) for the full product, as these provide the best user experience for legal professionals.
