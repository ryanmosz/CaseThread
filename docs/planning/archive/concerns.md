# Concerns & Risk Mitigation

## ⚖️ Legal Liability

**Concern:** Generated documents could contain errors leading to legal issues

**Mitigation:**
- Clear disclaimers: "AI-assisted tool, not legal advice"
- Target users are licensed attorneys who retain full legal responsibility
- Generated documents are drafts requiring attorney review
- No autonomous document filing or submission
- Audit trail of all AI generations
- Terms of service explicitly state attorney responsibility

## 🔐 Data Privacy

**Concern:** Sensitive client data in legal documents

**Mitigation:**
- Local-first architecture (data never leaves device)
- Only prompts sent to OpenAI, not full documents
- No client names/details in prompts
- Encrypted local storage
- User controls all data deletion
- GDPR/CCPA compliant design

## 📊 Quality Control

**Concern:** AI hallucinations or inconsistent output

**Mitigation:**
- Licensed attorneys review all output before use
- Temperature set low (0.3) for consistency
- Firm's own templates as base
- Learn from firm's approved documents
- Visual diff interface (stretch goal)
- Version control for all generations
