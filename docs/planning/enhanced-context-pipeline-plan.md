# CaseThread Multi-Model 3-Agent Quality Pipeline
## Project Plan & Technical Specification

**Version**: 2.1  
**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Project**: CaseThread Quality-First Document Generation with Strategic Model Selection  
**Objective**: Implement cost-optimized 3-agent quality pipeline with strategic GPT-4/o3 selection for IP attorneys

---

## Executive Summary

This project transforms CaseThread from a speed-focused single-call system into a quality-focused 3-agent pipeline with strategic model selection. The goal is to achieve partner-level document quality through iterative refinement, contextual intelligence, and rigorous quality gates - specifically designed for IP attorneys who value accuracy over speed.

**Key Principles:**
- Quality over speed (25-35 seconds vs 6 seconds)
- 3 specialized agents with strategic model selection (GPT-4 + o3)
- Cost optimization: 40-50% reduction vs all-o3 approach
- Iterative refinement with tailored feedback
- Contextual intelligence using existing ChromaDB system
- IP attorney workflow optimization

---

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Existing Architecture
CaseThread already has a sophisticated multi-agent system:

**Working Components:**
- **ContextBuilderAgent**: Retrieves relevant context from ChromaDB
- **DraftingAgent**: Generates documents using OpenAI o3
- **OverseerAgent**: Merges partial drafts (parallel processing)
- **Orchestrator**: Manages pipeline flow
- **ChromaDB System**: Vector search with legal precedents
- **Rich Mock Data**: High-quality legal memos and strategic analysis

**Current Flows:**
1. **Standard**: Context Builder → Drafting Agent → Save Document
2. **Parallel**: Context Builder → Multiple Drafting Agents → Overseer → Save Document

### 1.2 Critical Issues
1. **Context Not Used**: `ContextBundle` is retrieved but NOT passed to OpenAI service
2. **No Quality Gates**: Single-shot generation with no refinement
3. **No Feedback Loops**: Failed documents aren't improved
4. **Speed Over Quality**: Optimized for 6 seconds, not legal accuracy

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript, Node.js 20
- **AI Model**: OpenAI o3
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB with embeddings
- **Container**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Templates**: 8 IP document types (Patent Assignment, NDA, etc.)
- **Test Coverage**: 266 tests, 65.77% coverage
