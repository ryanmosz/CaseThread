## 🚀 Quick Facts

**What We're Building:**
- CLI tool for template-based document generation
- Multi-agent system with context-aware generation
- Learns from your firm's style and precedents  
- GUI interface coming in Phase 2
- Local-first, transparent, customizable

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript + Commander.js (CLI)
- Multi-Agent Architecture (Context Builder, Drafting Agent)
- ChromaDB for vector search
- Docker containerization
- Electron + React (GUI - Phase 2)
- Jest for TDD (266 tests passing)
- OpenAI API (user provides key)

**Current Features:**
- ✅ 8 document types fully functional
- ✅ YAML-based input system
- ✅ Template + Explanation system
- ✅ Multi-agent pipeline with ChromaDB
- ✅ Context learning via `learn` command
- ✅ Graceful degradation without ChromaDB

**Development Status:**
```
✅ Phase 1: CLI POC (Complete)
├── Core business logic
├── Template system  
├── Document generation
└── Command-line interface

🚧 Phase 2: Multi-Agent Integration (In Progress)
├── PR #1 integrated to feature branch
├── ChromaDB vector search working
├── Test coverage: 65.77% (target: 80%)
└── Performance: 33s avg generation

📅 Phase 3: GUI Development (Planned)
├── Electron application
├── React interface
├── CLI core integration
└── Visual features
```

**Target Users:**
- Licensed IP attorneys
- Small/mid IP firms (2-50 attorneys)
- Solo IP practitioners
- Currently priced out of Harvey ($100K+/year)

**Timeline:**
- ✅ Weeks 1-6: CLI POC Development (Complete)
- 🚧 Week 7: Multi-Agent Integration (Current)
- 📅 Weeks 8-11: GUI Development  
- 📅 Weeks 12-13: Beta Launch
- 📅 Months 4-6: Growth Phase

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Cost:** Free core + $99/month premium (vs Harvey's $100K+/year)
- **Speed:** 33 second average generation (with context retrieval)
- **Quality:** 90% acceptance rate on first generation
- **Privacy:** Local ChromaDB + only prompts to OpenAI
- **Test Coverage:** 65.77% (improving to 80%+)
- **Document Types:** 8 fully functional templates

## 🤝 For the Dev Team

1. Start with the [Coordination Guide](./coordination-guide.md)
2. Set up [GitHub Projects](./github-project-setup.md) for task tracking
3. Review the [Roadmap](./project-roadmap.md) together
4. Log decisions in [decisions.md](./decisions.md)
5. Check [Technical Implementation](./technical-implementation.md) for architecture

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Integration (NEW)

**PR #1 Status:** Integrated to `feature/integrate-multi-agent` branch

**What's New:**
- Context Builder Agent: Retrieves relevant context from ChromaDB
- Drafting Agent: Generates documents with context awareness
- Learn Command: Index existing documents for context
- ChromaDB: Vector database for semantic search

**Integration Documents:**
- [Integration Plan](../testing/MULTIAGENT_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)
- [Test Results](../testing/test-results/MULTIAGENT_TEST_RESULTS_20250708.md)
- [Test Plan](../testing/MULTIAGENT_TEST_PLAN.md)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Increase test coverage to 80%+
2. **This Week:** Merge multi-agent to main branch
3. **Next Week:** Begin GUI development phase
4. **Ongoing:** Performance optimization (target <20s generation)
