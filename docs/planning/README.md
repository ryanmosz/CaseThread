- ✅ Electron + React GUI (functional)
- 🚧 GUI/PDF Integration (Task 6 in progress)

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript + Commander.js (CLI)
- Electron + React + Tailwind (GUI)
- Langgraph for multi-agent orchestration
- ChromaDB for vector search
- PDFKit for document generation
- Docker containerization
- Jest for testing (670 tests passing)
- OpenAI API (user provides key)

**Current Features:**

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Cost:** Free core + premium tier planned
- **Speed:** 25-35 seconds with quality pipeline
- **Quality:** 3-agent refinement system
- **Privacy:** Local ChromaDB + only prompts to OpenAI
- **Test Coverage:** 670 tests passing
- **Document Types:** 8 fully functional templates

## 🔄 Current Focus: Task 6.0 - GUI Integration

**Objective:** Integrate the modular PDF service into the Electron GUI

**Key Components:**
1. IPC handlers for main/renderer communication
2. Buffer-based PDF preview in viewer pane
3. Progress reporting using BackgroundGenerationStatus
4. Export workflow with native save dialog
5. Error handling and user feedback

**Integration Points:**
- `PDFServiceFactory.forGUI()` for callback-based progress
- EnhancedDocumentViewer for PDF display
- Context bundle from quality pipeline
- AI Assistant for pre-generation editing
