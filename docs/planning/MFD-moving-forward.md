# CaseThread: Moving Forward

## Development Team
- **Developer R**: Created core CLI framework, testing infrastructure, Docker setup, leading PDF generation
- **Developer G**: Contributed multi-agent architecture, ChromaDB integration, leading GUI development

## MVP Goals (By Friday)
- Document generation with full edit/save/export workflow
- 3-pane Electron GUI functional
- All 8 document types working
- Professional PDF output with legal formatting
- All tests passing

## Division of Labor

### Developer G (GUI Lead)
- Electron app implementation
- 3-pane layout
- Text editor integration
- File browser (left pane)
- Forms and UI components
- Save/export workflow

### Developer R (Backend/PDF)
- PDF generation with PDFKit
- Legal formatting compliance
- Export service API
- Backend integration

## Friday Demo Workflow âœ…
1. User opens 3-pane GUI
2. Selects document type from right pane
3. Fills form in middle pane
4. Clicks "Generate Now"
5. Reviews generated document (editable text)
6. Makes manual edits as needed
7. Clicks "Save and Export to PDF"
8. Both text and PDF saved to project
9. Files appear in left pane
10. Can view saved files by clicking them

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: 3-pane layout (locked)
- **Input Method**: Form-based (locked)
- **Editor**: Editable text in middle pane (locked)
- **Export**: Both text and PDF files (locked)
- **PDF Library**: PDFKit (locked)

## Decisions for Developer G
- Save/Export button placement
- File organization structure
- Error handling UI
- Loading indicators
- Component libraries

## Removed from MVP
- Document summarization (now optional stretch goal)
- Tabbed interface in right pane
- Advanced file management
- Generative editing (weekend stretch goal)
