# CaseThread: Moving Forward

## Development Team
- **Developer R**: Created core CLI framework, testing infrastructure, Docker setup
- **Developer G**: Contributed multi-agent architecture, ChromaDB integration, context-aware generation

## MVP Goals (By Friday)
- All current features working without error
- Demo-ready system
- All tests passing (fix tests or code as needed)
- Comprehensive test suite demonstration
- Core Electron app with two major features

## MVP Features

### Core Functionality âœ…
- All 8 document types generating correctly
- Multi-agent system fully integrated
- ChromaDB learning and context retrieval
- Docker deployment

### Immediate Priorities

#### 1. Test Suite Completion
- Ensure 100% of existing tests pass
- Fix failing tests or adjust test expectations
- Create demo script for test suite

#### 2. Error Handling (If Time Permits)
- Basic user-friendly error messages
- Graceful failure modes

#### 3. Performance Baseline
- Document current performance (~30-35 seconds)
- Identify obvious bottlenecks only

## Electron App (Phase 2 - For Friday Demo)

### Critical Design Decision Required
**User Input Method for Document Generation:**
- **Option 1**: Form-based interface with fields for each template requirement
- **Option 2**: Conversational chat interface for gathering requirements
- Decision impacts entire GUI design

### Confirmed Features for Friday

#### 1. Drafting Support (Existing Functionality)
- Integration of current CLI document generation
- Template-based generation for all 8 document types
- PDF export functionality (lawyers need PDFs)

#### 2. Document Summary (New Feature)
- Summarize lengthy legal documents
- Identify key elements and extract information
- Answer complex legal questions from knowledge base
- Provide citations when possible
- Integration into Electron GUI

### Architecture Focus
Enable IP attorneys to focus on higher-value work by automating:
- Initial document drafting
- Document review and analysis
- Routine legal research tasks

### Stretch Goal (Weekend - Optional)
- Template customization functionality
- Allow attorneys to modify existing templates
- Not on roadmap unless time permits

### Under Consideration
- Real-time preview functionality
- Jurisdiction-specific knowledge for IP law
- Quality scoring system

## Possible Future Features

### Agent Enhancements
- QA Agent implementation
- Risk Assessment Agent
- Compliance Agent
- Agent performance metrics

### Extended Capabilities
- Template editor
- Template marketplace
- Custom template support
- Batch processing
- Output formats (PDF, DOCX)

### Enterprise/Integration Features
- Multi-user support
- Role-based access
- Law firm management system integration
- E-signature service integration
- Billing system integration

### AI/Analytics Features
- Fine-tuned legal language models
- Citation verification
- Document generation analytics
- Time-saving metrics

### Platform Features
- SaaS offering
- Plugin architecture
- Mobile app
- API marketplace

## Technical Notes

### Documentation Requirements
- Minimal user guide explaining program capabilities
- Basic setup instructions
- Template usage documentation

### Code Quality
- Current mock data structure is well-organized
- Standardized error patterns (if time permits)

## Success Criteria for Friday Demo
- [ ] All features demonstrated without crashes
- [ ] Complete test suite passes
- [ ] Document generation works for all 8 types
- [ ] Electron app with drafting support
- [ ] PDF export working
- [ ] Document summary feature functional
- [ ] Clear demonstration flow prepared

## Next Steps
1. Make input method decision (form vs chat)
2. Focus on test completion
3. Build Electron app with two features
4. Implement PDF functionality
5. Prepare demo script
6. Fix any blocking issues
7. Document setup process
