# CaseThread Demo Script - Dev-R (3 minutes)

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon everyone. I'm [Dev-R], and along with [Dev-G], we're excited to show you CaseThread - an open source alternative to Harvey AI designed specifically for IP attorneys.

We designed CaseThread to answer a simple question: How can we best harness the power of generative AI, to enhance the speed and quality of IP attorney work product while respecting the integrity of proprietary firm and client data.


## The Problem (45 seconds)

"Today, if you're an IP attorney and want AI assistance, you have two options:
1. Use generic AI tools that don't understand legal formatting or requirements
2. Use Harvey AI, currently the incumbent in the field, but Harvey comes with at least two significant drawbacks that we are targeting:

First, astronomical expense, and Second, onerous customer contracts - which means that even if a firm can afford it, that firm gives up significant control of their data to Harvey AI.

This leaves most IP attorneys - solo practitioners and small firms - without affordable, specialized, data integrity preserving generative AI tools. They're stuck with sparse templates, manually double-checking for consistency errors, and hoping they didn't miss anything.

## What is CaseThread? (45 seconds)

"CaseThread is an open-source legal document generation system built specifically for IP attorneys. 

What makes us different:
- **Free core functionality for basic use** - 
- **Data Integrity** - You choose exactly what data to include in context
- **Local-first** - your client data never leaves your computer

We support 8 critical IP document types:
- Patent applications and assignments
- Trademark applications  
- NDAs and licensing agreements
- Office action responses
- And more..."

## Why Open Source? (45 seconds)

"Why did we go open source? Three reasons:

**First - Trust**: Attorneys need to see exactly how their documents are created. With our code on GitHub, you can audit every prompt, every decision.

**Second - Customization**: Every firm has their own style. With CaseThread, you can modify templates, add your firm's specific language, even build custom features.

**Third - Community**: IP attorneys helping IP attorneys. When one firm improves a template, everyone benefits.

This isn't about replacing attorneys - it's about eliminating the tedious parts. Instead of spending an hour updating fields and checking consistency, you get a complete draft in seconds that just needs your expert review."

## How It Works - Quick Overview (30 seconds)

"The workflow is simple:
1. Select your document type
2. Fill in the required information once
3. CaseThread populates all fields throughout the document
4. Review and fine-tune as needed
5. Export to PDF with proper legal formatting

Everything happens locally on your computer. Only the prompts go to OpenAI - never your client data."

## Transition to Dev-G (15 seconds)

"Now, let me hand it over to [Dev-G] who will show you exactly how this works in practice, walking through a real patent assignment agreement from start to finish..."
