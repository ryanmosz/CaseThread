# CaseThread Demo Script - Dev-R (3 minutes)

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Good morning/afternoon everyone. I'm [Dev-R], together with [Dev-G], and we're excited to show you CaseThread - an open source alternative to Harvey AI designed specifically for IP attorneys.

We designed CaseThread to answer a simple question: How can we harness the power of generative AI for IP attorneys?
(while respecting their data security requirements?)


## The Problem (45 seconds)

"Today, if you're an IP attorney and want AI assistance, you have two options:
1. Use generic AI tools that don't understand legal context
or
2. Use Harvey AI, which while popular, comes with at least two significant drawbacks:

First, astronomical expense, and Second, onerous customer contracts - which means that even if a firm can afford it, that firm gives up significant control of their data to Harvey AI.

This leaves most IP attorneys - solo practitioners and small firms - without affordable, specialized and trustworthy generative AI tools. They're stuck with sparse templates, manual error checking, and hoping they don't miss anything. They're spending hours on what we'll help them achieve in minutes.

## What is CaseThread? (45 seconds)

"CaseThread is an open-source legal document generation system built specifically for IP attorneys. 

What makes us different:
- **Free core functionality for basic use** - we gain your trust before you pay us anything
- **Data Integrity** - You choose exactly what data to include in your personal context store
- **Context Aware Document Generation** - new documents are created given the context of previous work you decide to upload to your personal context store. From just the last document or email you sent to a single client, to every document ever produced by your firm. it's up to you, and we'll use that context intelligently as we help you prepare new work.
- **Local-first** - your client data never leaves your computer
- **Open Source - Trust But Verify**: Attorneys need transparency as to exactly how their documents are created. With our code on GitHub, you can audit every prompt, every decision. We'll work hard to gain your trust, but you never have to take our word for anything you can't independently verify.

Our slice supports 8 critical IP document types, such as:
- Patent applications and assignments
