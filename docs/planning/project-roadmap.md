- Adjust priorities

### Friday
- Code review
- Update roadmap
- Plan next week

## üìã Task Tracking

Using GitHub Projects with columns:
- **Backlog:** All future tasks
- **This Week:** Current sprint
- **In Progress:** Actively working
- **Review:** Needs code review
- **Done:** Completed

## üö® Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **CLI complexity:** Use established framework (Commander.js)
- **Core/GUI integration:** Clean architecture from start
- **Performance issues:** Profile early and often

### Market Risks
- **CLI adoption:** Some attorneys may prefer GUI-only
- **Competition:** Move fast, stay open
- **Support burden:** Build strong community
