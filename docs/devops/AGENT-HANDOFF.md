## Testing Requirements

### IMPORTANT: Always Show Test Progress Bar
When running tests, ALWAYS use commands that show the green progress bar at the bottom:
- Use `npm test` for all tests (shows progress bar)
- Use `npm test -- <path>` for specific test files (shows progress bar)
- AVOID using `jest` directly as it may not show the progress bar
- This helps identify hung tests quickly and saves debugging time
