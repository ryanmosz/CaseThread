## 🎯 Update Process for New Tasks

When switching to a new parent task:
1. Archive current plan-parent.md
2. Update only the "CURRENT TASK CONTEXT" section:
   - Current Focus
   - Developer assignment
   - Task Resources (update file paths)
   - Developer Focus Areas
   - Task-Specific Context
3. Leave everything below "END OF TASK-SPECIFIC SECTION" unchanged
4. Save and commit

## Benefits Summary
