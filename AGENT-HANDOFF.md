# AGENT-HANDOFF.md - CaseThread CLI Project State

## Last Updated: 2025-07-10T00:53:00Z

### Current Task Status
- **Active Task**: Parent Task 6.0 - Update JSON Templates with Signature Block Definitions
- **Sub-tasks Completed**: 
  - ✅ 6.1: Design and document signature block JSON schema
  - ✅ 6.2: Patent Assignment Agreement signature/initial blocks  
  - ✅ 6.3: Trademark Application signature/initial blocks
  - ✅ 6.4: Cease and Desist Letter signature/initial blocks
  - ✅ 6.5: NDA IP Specific signature/initial blocks
  - ✅ 6.6: Office Action Response signature/initial blocks
  - ✅ 6.7: Patent License Agreement signature/initial blocks
  - ✅ 6.8: Provisional Patent Application signature/initial blocks
- **Next Task**: 6.9 Technology Transfer Agreement signature/initial blocks
- **Remaining**: Tasks 6.9-6.12 (2 more templates + TypeScript updates + testing)

### Recent Changes

#### Task 6.8 Implementation (Provisional Patent Application)
- Followed TDD approach: wrote tests first, watched them fail, then implemented
- Added inventor signature and optional witness signature
- Created 6 new tests (total now 311)
- All tests pass - no test modifications needed

#### Updated prompt.md with TDD Requirements
- Added comprehensive TDD sections to guide future development
- Established Test Integrity Principle: fix functionality, not tests
- Created mandatory testing report format
- Added quality gates preventing progression with failing tests

### Current Architecture Decisions

1. **Signature Block Standardization**: Using traditional signature blocks only
   - No electronic signature formats (removed `/name/` style)
   - No redundant text signature lines
   - PDF generator will render traditional signature areas

2. **Testing Philosophy**: TDD with Test Integrity
   - Write tests before implementation when feasible
   - Tests define the contract - fix implementation, not tests
   - Document any test modifications with justification
   - Include testing report with all task completions

### Critical Path Forward

1. **Complete remaining templates** (Tasks 6.9)
   - Only Technology Transfer Agreement remains
2. **Update TypeScript interfaces** (Task 6.10)
3. **Run comprehensive test suite** (Task 6.11)
4. **Update documentation** (Task 6.12)

### Testing Summary
- **Total Tests**: 311 (up from 269 when signature work started)
- **All tests passing**
- **New signature block tests**: 42 total across all templates
- **Test coverage includes**: schema validation, marker presence, document generation
