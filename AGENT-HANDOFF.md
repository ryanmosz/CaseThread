# CaseThread Project - Agent Handoff Document

## Project Overview
CaseThread is a CLI proof of concept for generating legal documents using OpenAI's API and a template system. The project combines JSON templates, explanation files, and YAML input data to generate professional legal documents.

## Current Status
- **Current Branch**: `feature/task-5.0-cli-interface`
- **Current Parent Task**: 5.0 - Build CLI interface with Commander (STARTING)
- **Previous Task**: 4.0 - Implement OpenAI integration ✅ COMPLETE & MERGED
- **Next Parent Task**: 6.0 - Create comprehensive test suite

## Recent Changes
1. **Task 4.0 OpenAI Integration - COMPLETE & MERGED**:
   - Implemented complete OpenAI integration with o3 model at temperature 0.2
   - Created OpenAI service with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
   - Added 60-second timeout protection for API calls
   - Implemented response validation for markdown documents
   - Added cost estimation and logging based on token usage
   - Created comprehensive mock OpenAI service for testing
   - All 207 tests passing with 100% coverage of new code
   - Updated .env.example with required OpenAI configuration
   - Service handles API unavailability gracefully (reports and exits)
   - No streaming support (o3 doesn't support it)
   - Minimum document length validation (50 chars)
   - High-cost warning for requests over $1.00
   - **Git workflow properly executed**: Branch merged to main locally and pushed

2. **Task Organization Update**:
   - Completed task planning documents moved to `docs/tasks/complete/` subdirectory
   - Keeps active tasks directory clean and organized
   - Easy to reference completed work

3. **Previous Tasks Completed & Merged**:
   - Task 3.0: Core services (template, YAML, logging) - MERGED
   - Task 2.0: TypeScript project initialization - MERGED
   - Task 1.0: Docker setup - MERGED

## Task 4.0 Implementation Details
- Created `src/types/openai.ts` with OpenAI-specific types
- Created `src/utils/retry.ts` with retry and timeout utilities
- Implemented `src/services/openai.ts` with full error handling
- Implemented `src/services/mock-openai.ts` for testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Created comprehensive documentation (now in `docs/tasks/complete/`):
  - `prd-parent-task-4.0.md` - Product Requirements
  - `tasks-parent-4.0-checklist.md` - Task checklist
  - `tasks-parent-4.0-detailed.md` - Detailed implementation guide

## Verification Tests Passed ✅
- `npm run build` - TypeScript compiles successfully
- `npm test` - 207 tests passing (includes all new OpenAI tests)
- Mock service enables testing without real API calls
- Error handling verified for all scenarios
- Retry logic and timeout protection working

## Docker Commands Reference
- Start container: `docker-compose up -d`
- Execute commands: `docker exec casethread-dev <command>`
- Interactive shell: `docker exec -it casethread-dev bash`
- Stop container: `docker-compose down`

## Important Project Files
- **Task List**: `docs/tasks/tasks-cli-poc-plan.md`
- **Tech Stack**: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- **CLI Design**: `docs/planning/cli-poc-plan.md`
- **Git Workflows**: `docs/devops/git-workflow.md`
- **Development Prompt**: `docs/devops/prompt.md`
- **Parent Task Planning**: `docs/devops/plan-parent.md`
- **Completed Task Docs**: `docs/tasks/complete/` directory

## Development Workflow Files
Located in `docs/devops/`:
- `prompt.md` - Main development prompt for subtasks
- `plan-parent.md` - Parent task planning workflow (creates PRD, checklist, details)
- `git-workflow.md` - Git workflows (SUBTASK-COMMIT, PARENT-COMPLETE)

## Workflow Usage Pattern
1. For parent tasks: Use `plan-parent.md` to generate PRD, checklist, and detailed files
2. For subtasks: Use `prompt.md` with references to the generated parent task files
3. Git operations: Follow workflows in `git-workflow.md`

## Next Steps
Task 5.0 is ready to begin! Focus on:
- Task 5.0: Build CLI interface with Commander
  - 5.1 Create src/index.ts with shebang and Commander setup
  - 5.2 Implement src/commands/generate.ts with document type and input path arguments
  - 5.3 Add --output flag for custom output directory
  - 5.4 Integrate spinner updates throughout the generation process
  - 5.5 Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
  - 5.6 Add --debug flag to enable verbose logging
  - 5.7 Create output file with timestamp-based naming pattern
- Future: Task 6.0: Create comprehensive test suite
