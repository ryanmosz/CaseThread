#### Prompt Enhancement (2025-01-15)
- Added "Task Analysis and Sequencing" section to prompt.md
- Provides guidance for analyzing subtask dependencies
- Recommends optimal implementation approaches (sequential/parallel/hybrid)
- Ensures quality-focused development with proper testing checkpoints

#### Task 6.0 Completion Summary
- Implemented signature blocks for all 8 document types
- Created flexible TypeScript interfaces supporting both StandardSignatureBlock and OfficeActionSignatureBlock
- Added support for single, side-by-side, and grouped signature layouts
- Implemented initial blocks and notary blocks where required
- All 318 tests passing (including 42 new signature block tests)
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/templates/signature-block-schema.md

#### Pre-PDF Development Cleanup
- Moved all Task 6 files to docs/tasks/complete/
- Organized planning folder with archive subdirectories
- No files deleted - everything preserved
- Main branch updated with signature block implementation

### Current Architecture Decisions

1. **Signature Block Implementation**: Completed
   - Flexible layout system (single, side-by-side, grouped)
   - Marker-based positioning in generated text
   - TypeScript union types for different block formats
   - PDF generator will parse these markers for positioning

2. **PDF Generation Approach**: Starting implementation
   - Using PDFKit for document generation
   - Legal formatting requirements documented
   - Document-specific spacing rules defined
   - Signature block positioning logic planned

### Critical Path Forward

1. **Create PDF Generation Service** (Task 2)
   - Set up PDFKit with legal document standards
   - Implement document-specific formatting
   - Parse signature block markers
   - Page break prevention for signatures
2. **Implement Signature Block Handling** (Task 3)
3. **Create CLI Export Command** (Task 4)
4. **Test All Document Types** (Task 5)
5. **Integration Preparation** (Task 6)

### Testing Summary
- **Total Tests**: 336 (all passing)
- **Signature block tests**: 42 across all templates
- **PDF generation tests**: 18 (3 setup + 15 LegalPDFGenerator)
- **Test approach**: TDD with test integrity maintained
- **Next focus**: Page management and formatting rules

### Prompt.md Analysis Completed
- **Old prompt**: Extracted as prompt-old.md (340 lines, Task 6.0 focused)
- **New prompt**: Streamlined to 125 lines (63% reduction, Task 2.0 focused)  
- **Comparison report**: Created docs/devops/prompt-comparison-report.md
- **Key findings**:
  - All critical functionality retained (git workflow, tech stack, testing, standards)
  - Improved organization with clear sections and visual hierarchy
  - Task-specific context now easily updatable
  - No loss of essential requirements or constraints
  - Better maintainability for task transitions
  - Updated TDD philosophy to clearer phrasing: "Tests prove functionality works"
- **Critical Update**: Restored detailed testing requirements to 152 lines total
  - Changed to "Tests define the product" per user preference
  - Restored all proven testing language that was oversimplified
  - Kept streamlined structure while preserving battle-tested guidance

### Archival Workflow Implemented
- **Created archive/ directory structure**:
  - `archive/devops/` - Old versions of DevOps files (prompts, workflows)
  - `archive/handoff/` - Historical AGENT-HANDOFF.md files  
  - `archive/prompts/` - Previous versions of plan prompts
  - `archive/README.md` - Documentation of archival procedures
- **Moved existing files**: prompt-old.md and prompt-comparison-report.md to archive/devops/
- **Updated prompt.md**: Added File Archival Workflow section
- **Created cursor rule**: `.cursor/rules/file-archival.mdc` to enforce archival practices
- **Key principle**: NEVER delete AGENT-HANDOFF.md or critical files - always archive with timestamp

### Plan-Parent.md Restructured to Task-Agnostic Format
- **Archived current version**: `archive/devops/plan-parent-2025-07-10-pdf-generation.md`
- **Restructured with clear sections**:
  - üéØ CURRENT TASK CONTEXT - All task-specific info in one updatable section
  - üîß CORE PROCESS - Task-agnostic PRD generation process
  - üìö INTERNAL DOCUMENTATION - Documentation guidance
  - üìã DEVELOPMENT PLAN STRUCTURE - Standard plan sections
  - üß™ TESTING PROCEDURE - Mandatory testing requirements
  - üìÅ FILE MANAGEMENT - Output structure and archival
  - üéØ TARGET AUDIENCE - Junior developer focus
  - üìù FORMATTING STANDARDS - Markdown requirements
- **Benefits**: 
  - Easy to update when switching tasks
  - All changeable content in one section at top
  - Task-agnostic process preserved below
  - Reduced from 236 to 229 lines while improving clarity

### Critical Files Guide Created
- **New documentation**: `docs/devops/critical-files-guide.md` (218 lines)
- **Comprehensive guide covering**:
  - Purpose and usage of AGENT-HANDOFF.md
  - Purpose and usage of prompt.md
  - Purpose and usage of plan-parent.md
  - Detailed archival workflow for all three files
  - Best practices and benefits
  - Quick reference table
- **Key insight**: These three files represent the institutional memory of the project
- **Updated**: documentation-organization-guide.md to reference new guide

### Next Steps for Task 2.0 Implementation

#### Recommended Sequencing (Hybrid Approach)
Based on task analysis, recommend the following approach:
1. **Phase 1 - Foundation**: ‚úÖ Complete (Task 2.1 - PDFKit setup)
2. **Phase 2 - Core Components**:
   - Start with 2.2 (Base PDF Generator) - establish basic PDF creation
   - Then parallelize 2.3 (Formatting Rules) and 2.4 (Signature Parser)
   - Test each component independently
3. **Phase 3 - Integration**: 
   - 2.5 (Layout Engine) - requires 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
   - 2.6 (CLI Command) - user interface
   - 2.7 (Comprehensive tests) or use TDD throughout

#### Key Technical Decisions Made
- PDFKit chosen and verified in Docker environment
- Test structure established: `__tests__/services/pdf/`
- .gitignore updated for test output files
- Tech stack documentation updated

#### Files Modified in Task 2.2
- `src/types/pdf.ts` - Added TextOptions interface
- `src/services/pdf/LegalPDFGenerator.ts` - Added text writing methods
- `__tests__/services/pdf/LegalPDFGenerator.test.ts` - Added 7 new tests (15 total)
- `docs/tasks/tasks-parent-2.0-checklist.md` - Marked 2.2.3 complete

#### Files Modified in Task 2.1
- `package.json` - Added pdfkit and @types/pdfkit
- `package-lock.json` - Updated dependencies
- `.gitignore` - Added test-output exclusions
- `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` - Added PDF generation section
- `docs/tasks/tasks-parent-2.0-checklist.md` - Marked 2.1 complete
- `__tests__/services/pdf/pdfkit-setup.test.ts` - Created with 3 tests
- `docs/devops/prompt.md` - Added task sequencing guidance

#### Important Notes
- All 336 tests passing (no regression)
- PDFKit uses built-in Times-Roman font (no external fonts needed)
- Letter size configuration verified (8.5" x 11" with 1" margins)
- LegalPDFGenerator class supports method chaining for fluent API
- Text writing methods tested and working with proper formatting
- Page numbering deferred to Task 2.5 due to PDFKit limitations
- Ready to implement page management in Task 2.2.4
