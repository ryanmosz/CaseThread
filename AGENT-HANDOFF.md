### Recent Changes

#### Task 6.0 Completion Summary
- Implemented signature blocks for all 8 document types
- Created flexible TypeScript interfaces supporting both StandardSignatureBlock and OfficeActionSignatureBlock
- Added support for single, side-by-side, and grouped signature layouts
- Implemented initial blocks and notary blocks where required
- All 318 tests passing (including 42 new signature block tests)
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/templates/signature-block-schema.md

#### Pre-PDF Development Cleanup
- Moved all Task 6 files to docs/tasks/complete/
- Organized planning folder with archive subdirectories
- No files deleted - everything preserved
- Main branch updated with signature block implementation

### Current Architecture Decisions

1. **Signature Block Implementation**: Completed
   - Flexible layout system (single, side-by-side, grouped)
   - Marker-based positioning in generated text
   - TypeScript union types for different block formats
   - PDF generator will parse these markers for positioning

2. **PDF Generation Approach**: Starting implementation
   - Using PDFKit for document generation
   - Legal formatting requirements documented
   - Document-specific spacing rules defined
   - Signature block positioning logic planned

### Critical Path Forward

1. **Create PDF Generation Service** (Task 2)
   - Set up PDFKit with legal document standards
   - Implement document-specific formatting
   - Parse signature block markers
   - Page break prevention for signatures
2. **Implement Signature Block Handling** (Task 3)
3. **Create CLI Export Command** (Task 4)
4. **Test All Document Types** (Task 5)
5. **Integration Preparation** (Task 6)

### Testing Summary
- **Total Tests**: 318 (all passing)
- **Signature block tests**: 42 across all templates
- **Test approach**: TDD with test integrity maintained
- **Next focus**: PDF generation tests

### Prompt.md Analysis Completed
- **Old prompt**: Extracted as prompt-old.md (340 lines, Task 6.0 focused)
- **New prompt**: Streamlined to 125 lines (63% reduction, Task 2.0 focused)  
- **Comparison report**: Created docs/devops/prompt-comparison-report.md
- **Key findings**:
  - All critical functionality retained (git workflow, tech stack, testing, standards)
  - Improved organization with clear sections and visual hierarchy
  - Task-specific context now easily updatable
  - No loss of essential requirements or constraints
  - Better maintainability for task transitions
  - Updated TDD philosophy to clearer phrasing: "Tests prove functionality works"
- **Critical Update**: Restored detailed testing requirements to 152 lines total
  - Changed to "Tests define the product" per user preference
  - Restored all proven testing language that was oversimplified
  - Kept streamlined structure while preserving battle-tested guidance
