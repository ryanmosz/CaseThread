# CaseThread Project - Agent Handoff Document

## Project Overview
CaseThread is a CLI proof of concept for generating legal documents using OpenAI's API and a template system. The project combines JSON templates, explanation files, and YAML input data to generate professional legal documents.

## Current Status
- **Current Branch**: `feature/task-4.0-openai-integration`
- **Current Parent Task**: 4.0 - Implement OpenAI integration (STARTING)
- **Previous Task**: 3.0 - Implement core services ✅ COMPLETE & MERGED
- **Next Parent Task**: 5.0 - Build CLI interface with Commander

## Recent Changes
1. **Task 3.0 Core Services - COMPLETE & MERGED**:
   - Implemented all core services with full test coverage (153 tests passing)
   - Merged to main branch and pushed to GitHub
   - Updated README.md and project roadmap to reflect completion
   - Created new feature branch for task 4.0

2. **Task 3.0 Implementation Details**:
   - Created comprehensive TypeScript type definitions (DocumentType, YamlData, Template, etc.)
   - Implemented validator utility with SUPPORTED_TYPES array and validation functions
   - Built Winston-based logger with console and file transports
   - Created Ora-wrapped spinner utility with TTY fallback
   - Implemented template service with JSON/markdown loading and validation
   - Implemented YAML service with parsing, validation, and error formatting
   - Created comprehensive unit tests across 5 test files

3. **Task 2.0 Previously Completed & Merged**:
   - Complete TypeScript project initialization
   - All dependencies installed and configured
   - npm scripts configured for development workflow

## Task 2.0 Results ✅ MERGED TO MAIN
- [x] 2.1 Created package.json with `casethread-poc` name
- [x] 2.2 Installed TypeScript v5.7.3 and @types/node
- [x] 2.3 Created tsconfig.json with CommonJS module system
- [x] 2.4 Installed core dependencies: commander, openai, js-yaml, ora, winston, dotenv, chalk
- [x] 2.5 Installed dev dependencies: jest, ts-jest, eslint, prettier, nodemon
- [x] 2.6 Configured all npm scripts (dev, build, test, lint, format)
- [x] 2.7 .env.example already exists as mentioned

## Task 3.0 COMPLETED (Core Services Implementation)
All phases complete:
- [x] 3.1 Create TypeScript type definitions ✅
- [x] 3.2 Implement validator utility ✅
- [x] 3.3 Create logger utility ✅
- [x] 3.4 Implement template service ✅
- [x] 3.5 Implement YAML service ✅
- [x] 3.6 Create spinner utility ✅
- [x] 3.7 Write comprehensive unit tests ✅ (153 tests, all passing)

## Verification Tests Passed ✅
- `npm run build` - TypeScript compiles successfully
- `npm test` - Jest runs (passes with no tests)
- `npm run cli` - ts-node executes TypeScript directly
- Created src/ and __tests__/ directories
- Created basic index.ts file

## Docker Commands Reference
- Start container: `docker-compose up -d`
- Execute commands: `docker exec casethread-dev <command>`
- Interactive shell: `docker exec -it casethread-dev bash`
- Stop container: `docker-compose down`

## Important Project Files
- **Task List**: `docs/tasks/tasks-cli-poc-plan.md`
- **Tech Stack**: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`
- **CLI Design**: `docs/planning/cli-poc-plan.md`
- **Git Workflows**: `docs/devops/git-workflow.md`
- **Development Prompt**: `docs/devops/prompt.md`
- **Parent Task Planning**: `docs/devops/plan-parent.md`

## Development Workflow Files
Located in `docs/devops/`:
- `prompt.md` - Main development prompt for subtasks (now includes parent task references)
- `plan-parent.md` - Parent task planning workflow (creates PRD, checklist, details)
- `git-workflow.md` - Git workflows (SUBTASK-COMMIT, PARENT-COMPLETE)

## Workflow Usage Pattern
1. For parent tasks: Use `plan-parent.md` to generate PRD, checklist, and detailed files
2. For subtasks: Use `prompt.md` with references to the generated parent task files
3. Git operations: Follow workflows in `git-workflow.md`

## Next Steps
Task 4.0 is ready to start! Focus on:
- Task 4.0: Implement OpenAI integration
  - 4.1 Create src/services/openai.ts with OpenAI client initialization
  - 4.2 Implement buildPrompt function to combine template, explanation, and YAML data
  - 4.3 Create generateDocument function with error handling and retry logic
  - 4.4 Add timeout handling for long-running API calls (60 second timeout)
  - 4.5 Implement response validation to ensure valid markdown output
  - 4.6 Add cost estimation based on token count (optional logging)
  - 4.7 Create mock OpenAI service for testing purposes
- Future: Task 5.0: Build CLI interface with Commander
- Future: Task 6.0: Create comprehensive test suite
