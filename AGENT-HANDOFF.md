## Project: CaseThread CLI Proof of Concept

### Status: ‚úÖ PROJECT COMPLETE - All 5 Parent Tasks Finished and Merged to Main

### Quick Project Info
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js 20, TypeScript, Commander.js v13, Docker, OpenAI API (o3 model)
- **Main Branch**: All features merged and pushed to GitHub
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/ryanmosz/CaseThread.git  
- **Docker Container**: casethread-dev (running on port 3005)

### Current Project State
‚úÖ **All 5 Parent Tasks Complete and Merged to Main Branch**

The CaseThread CLI is fully functional and has been tested with real scenarios. All major features are implemented and working correctly.

### üö® CRITICAL: Collaborative Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT UPDATE**: This is now a shared repository with two developers.

- **Developer R (Ryan)**: Works on R branch, focuses on PDF generation and backend
- **Developer G (Gaurang)**: Works on G branch, focuses on GUI and frontend
- **Workflow Document**: `docs/devops/git-workflow-shared.md`

**Key Rules**:
1. NEVER push directly to main branch
2. Each developer works on their own integration branch (R or G)
3. Feature branches created off personal branches (e.g., feature/r-pdf-generation)
4. Main branch updates require explicit coordination between both developers
5. See `docs/devops/git-workflow-shared.md` for detailed workflows

**Current Branch Status**:
- Main branch: Contains shared documentation and stable code
- R branch: Developer R's integration branch (active)
- G branch: To be created by Developer G

### üîî PENDING: Multi-Agent System Integration (PR #1)

**Important**: There is an open pull request (#1) from team member `sinedd777` that introduces a major architectural change:

- **PR Title**: "test: add comprehensive test coverage for multi-agent system"
- **Scope**: +4,958 lines / -1,616 lines across 21 files
- **Major Changes**:
  - Transforms CLI into multi-agent system with ChromaDB vector search
  - Adds Context Builder and Drafting agents
  - New `learn` command for document indexing
  - Requires additional ChromaDB Docker container

**Integration Planning**: Complete integration planning documents have been created in `docs/planning/integration-setup/`:
- `Integration-Plan.md` - Comprehensive integration strategy
- `migration-guide.md` - User migration instructions
- `scripts/` - Integration and test fix scripts
- `docker-compose-multiagent.yml` - Proposed Docker configuration

**Current Branch**: `feature/integration` contains all planning documents but NO actual integration work yet. This serves as a checkpoint before integration begins.

**Pre-Integration Checkpoint**: 
- Commit: `4e79c31921c223d420108b1717f48d6906e6c196`
- Project structure cleaned up:
  - `decisions.md` moved to `docs/architecture/`
  - Test scripts moved to `docs/testing/test-scripts/`
  - Test results directory created at `docs/testing/test-results/`
- All 237 tests passing
- Ready for integration

### Test Status
- **237 tests passing** across all test suites
- **1 test suite with TypeScript compilation issues** (generate.test.ts) - This is due to TypeScript configuration issues, not functionality problems
- **CLI functionality verified** - Successfully generates all 8 document types
- **All core functionality working** as expected

### Known Issues
1. **generate.test.ts TypeScript Compilation**: The test file has TypeScript compilation errors related to module imports, but the actual CLI command works perfectly. The TypeScript errors don't affect functionality.

### Available Document Types
1. cease-and-desist-letter
2. nda-ip-specific  
3. office-action-response
4. patent-assignment-agreement
5. patent-license-agreement
6. provisional-patent-application
7. technology-transfer-agreement
8. trademark-application

### Testing the CLI
```bash
# Basic usage
docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate <document-type> <input-yaml>

# Example with test data
docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate patent-assignment-agreement docs/testing/scenario-inputs/tfs-01-patent-assignment-founders.yaml

# With custom output directory
docker exec casethread-dev npm run cli -- generate trademark-application docs/testing/scenario-inputs/rtp-02-trademark-application.yaml --output ./my-docs
```

### Important Implementation Details
1. **OpenAI o3 Model Requirements**:
   - Use `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`
   - Do not set `temperature` parameter (o3 only supports default value of 1)

2. **Template Service Enhancement**: 
   - Now properly validates templates and throws TemplateLoadError
   - Checks for empty explanation files
   - Provides better error messages

### For Next Agent
The project is functionally complete with comprehensive documentation. The only remaining issue is TypeScript configuration for one test file, which doesn't affect the actual functionality of the CLI.

**IMPORTANT**: Before integrating PR #1, review the integration planning documents in `docs/planning/integration-setup/`. This is a major architectural change that transforms the simple CLI into a multi-agent system.

### ‚úÖ Multi-Agent Integration Complete and Ready for Main!

**Final Integration Status**: Successfully integrated and tested PR #1
- Branch: `feature/integrate-multi-agent`
- Latest Commit: `38c29b2` (fix: eliminate ChromaDB deprecation warning)

2. **ChromaDB Vector Database**
   - Semantic search for similar documents
   - Learns from firm's existing documents
   - Graceful fallback when offline
   - Fixed deprecation warnings

3. **New CLI Commands**
   - `learn`: Index existing documents for context retrieval
   - `generate`: Enhanced with multi-agent pipeline
