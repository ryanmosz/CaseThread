### Recent Work - Task 6.0.3.1 Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: PDF generation button showed success message but no PDF was displayed
- **Root Cause**: API mismatch between usePDFGeneration hook and ElectronAPI
  - Hook used `window.electronAPI.generatePDF()` but actual method was `window.electronAPI.pdf.generate()`
  - Hook used non-existent event listener methods
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Updated hook to use correct API methods
  - Added temporary PDF display using blob URL in new window
  - Updated preload script for backward compatibility
  - Fixed TypeScript types and imports
- **Result**: PDF generation now works - opens PDF in new browser window
- **Note**: Proper PDF display within app will be implemented in Task 6.0.4

### Task 6.0.2 Progress (IPC Infrastructure) - In Progress (3/4)
- **Completed**:
  - âœ… 6.0.2.1: Create PDF generation IPC handler
    - Implemented `PDFGenerationHandler` class at `src/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.ts`
    - Created type-safe IPC interfaces at `src/types/pdf-ipc.ts`
    - Implemented request validation for all document types
    - Added progress event conversion from ProgressEvent to IPC format
    - Integrated with main process initialization and cleanup
    - Created comprehensive test suite (22 tests) at `__tests__/electron/main/ipc/pdf-generation-handler.test.ts`
    - Fixed type compatibility between PDFServiceFactory and ProgressCallback
  - âœ… 6.0.2.2: Implement progress reporting IPC channel
    - Created ProgressManager with batched updates (100ms intervals)
    - Implemented ProgressHandlers for subscription management
    - Integrated with PDFGenerationHandler for centralized control
    - Created usePDFProgress React hook for component integration
    - Updated preload script with PDF operations API
    - Added comprehensive test coverage (16 tests)
  - âœ… 6.0.2.3: Add PDF export IPC handler
    - Implemented `PDFExportHandler` class at `src/electron/main/ipc/pdf-export-handler.ts`
    - Created both interactive (with dialog) and silent export modes
    - Added comprehensive validation (buffer size, PDF header, file paths)
    - Implemented filename sanitization for cross-platform compatibility
    - Created `usePDFExport` React hook at `src/electron/renderer/src/hooks/usePDFExport.ts`
    - Added file system error handling (permissions, disk space, invalid paths)
    - Created comprehensive test suite (15 tests) at `__tests__/electron/main/ipc/pdf-export-handler.test.ts`
- **Next Step**: Task 6.0.2.4 - Create IPC security validation

### Recent Changes - R+G Integration (2025-07-12)

#### Integration Branch Creation
- **Created**: `feature/r-g-integration` branch from R's `feature/pdf-generation`
- **Merged**: G's `origin/feature/g-multiagent-v2` (commit 2a29190 "enhanced docs")
- **Resolved Conflicts**: 
  - package.json - kept both R's PDF dependencies and G's Electron/React dependencies
  - package-lock.json - regenerated with combined dependencies (772 packages added)

#### What's Now Integrated:
**From R's branch (PDF Generation):**
- Complete PDF generation service with PDFKit
- Document-specific formatting rules for all 8 document types
- Signature block parsing and positioning
- PDF layout engine with page break prevention
- CLI export command with progress indicators
- Comprehensive test suite (597 tests, all passing)
- Known problems documentation

**From G's branch (Electron GUI):**
- Electron application framework
- React-based frontend with HeroUI components
- Document browser and enhanced viewer
- Template selector and form components
- Theme switching (light/dark mode)
- Memory bank system for context management
- Vite build configuration for Electron
- Organized document saving infrastructure

#### Test Fixes Applied (2025-07-12)
- Fixed all 25 failing pdf-export tests by adding missing `getPagesWithContent()` to mock
- Updated page numbering test expectations to match automatic page numbering behavior
- Created `docs/KNOWN_PROBLEMS.md` documenting:
  - HTML entities in generated documents (`&nbsp;` issue)
  - Signature block formatting issues (missing lines and spacing)

### Current State Summary
- **Tests**: All 597 tests passing âœ…
- **PDF Generation**: Fully functional via CLI
- **GUI**: Electron app ready for integration
- **Demo Script**: Created and preserved at `docs/planning/demo-script-dev-r.md`
- **Known Issues**: Documented in `docs/KNOWN_PROBLEMS.md`
- **Ready for**: Friday demo and further integration work

### Critical Path Forward

1. **Integration Testing** (Next Priority)
   - Test CLI commands work alongside Electron app
   - Ensure PDF generation can be triggered from GUI
   - Verify document browsing works with generated PDFs
   
2. **Connect GUI to PDF Service**
   - Wire up template form to PDF generation
   - Add export buttons to document viewer
   - Implement progress indicators in GUI

3. **Demo Preparation**
   - Test all 8 document types end-to-end
   - Ensure both CLI and GUI demos work smoothly
   - Prepare fallback options if needed

### Testing Summary
- **Total Tests**: 597 tests (ALL PASSING!)
  - PDF generation tests: 279 total
  - Other tests: 318
- **Integration Status**: Both R and G code successfully merged
- **No regressions**: All existing functionality preserved

### File Structure Changes
**New directories from G's work:**
- `src/electron/` - Electron main, preload, and renderer code
- `src/shared/` - Shared types between frontend and backend
- `memory-bank/` - Context management system files
- Various config files: `forge.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `vite.*.config.ts`

**Preserved from R's work:**
- `src/services/pdf/` - All PDF generation services intact
- `src/commands/` - CLI commands including export
- All test files and documentation

### Next Steps for Integration
1. Run `npm run electron:dev` to test Electron app
2. Verify PDF generation still works via CLI
3. Begin wiring GUI components to backend services
4. Test document flow from input â†’ generation â†’ viewing
5. Prepare demo scenarios for both CLI and GUI usage

#### Next Sub-task: 2.6.5 - Handle errors gracefully (next)

## 5. Current Challenges & Blockers ðŸš¨

**PDF Generation Issues Discovered:**
1. **Markdown Syntax Appearing in PDFs**
   - `#` characters showing instead of rendering as headings
   - `**` characters showing instead of rendering as bold text
   - `---` showing as three dashes instead of rendering as horizontal lines
   - Root cause: PDF export treats input as plain text, not Markdown

2. **Blank Pages Issue**
   - Pages 2, 4, and 5 are blank in generated PDFs
   - Needs investigation into page break/content flow logic

**Solution Approach:**
- Keep Markdown in input files (provides structure)
- Parse Markdown to extract formatting intent
- Apply formatting in PDF without showing syntax characters
- Added Tasks 2.8 (Markdown parsing) and 2.9 (blank pages) to roadmap

**Test Output Organization Issue:**
- âœ… Fixed: Was incorrectly saving test files to root directory
- Now properly using `docs/testing/test-results/` folder as per guidelines
