### Next Priority

**Task 6.5**: NDA IP Specific signature/initial blocks
- ⏳ Ready to start Task 6.5.1 (Investigation phase)
- Need to investigate and implement signature blocks for NDA IP Specific
- Expected to have signatures for both parties (mutual NDA)
- May require page initials

### Task 6.4.1 Investigation Summary
- Analyzed generated cease and desist letter structure
- Confirmed single attorney signature requirement
- Signature placement: Between "Sincerely," and attorney name
- No witness/notary/initial blocks needed
- Current template has placeholders but needs proper signature block definition

## Key Implementation Details

### Signature Block Schema
The signature block schema (defined in Task 6.1) includes:
- **SignatureBlock**: Core structure with id, type, placement, layout, party, and optional notary/witness requirements
- **InitialBlock**: For page-by-page or section-specific initials
- **Placement System**: Location-based (e.g., "after-section-5") with text markers
- **Layout Options**: Standalone or side-by-side positioning
- **Field Definitions**: Flexible field configuration with required/optional flags

### Template Updates Progress
- ✅ Patent Assignment Agreement (Task 6.2)
- ✅ Trademark Application (Task 6.3)
- ✅ Cease and Desist Letter (Task 6.4)
- ⏳ NDA IP Specific (Task 6.5)
- ⏳ Office Action Response (Task 6.6)
- ⏳ Patent License Agreement (Task 6.7)
- ⏳ Provisional Patent Application (Task 6.8)
- ⏳ Technology Transfer Agreement (Task 6.9)

## Testing Status

All tests passing:
- ✅ Template service tests
- ✅ Full test suite (269 tests)
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## Important Notes

1. **Marker Integration**: The signature block markers are defined in templates but not yet appearing in generated documents. This requires OpenAI service updates (likely in a future task).

2. **Multiple Assignors**: Patent Assignment template supports multiple assignors (common for founder assignments).

3. **Notary Requirements**: Added notary block support for documents requiring official recording (USPTO, etc.).

4. **Test-Driven Approach**: Each template update includes thorough testing to ensure no regressions.

## Git Status

- Current branch: R
- All changes committed
- Ready for next task

## Environment

- Docker development environment active
- Node.js 20 Alpine with TypeScript
- All dependencies installed and working

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Task 6.3: Trademark Application signature/initial blocks
2. Follow same pattern: investigate → implement → test
3. Update checklist after each subtask
4. Run full test suite after each template update
