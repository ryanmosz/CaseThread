# Agent Handoff Document

This document tracks the current state of the CaseThread CLI POC project for seamless agent transitions.

Last Updated: 2025-01-08 (Developer R)
Current Branch: R

## Current Status

**Working on Parent Task 6.0**: Update JSON Templates with Signature Block Definitions
- Focus: Adding signature blocks, initial blocks, and placement markers to all 8 document templates
- Progress: Tasks 6.1 and 6.2 complete, 6.3-6.12 pending

### Recent Completions

**Prompt.md Generalized** (2025-01-08):
- ‚úÖ Removed task-specific references from template guidelines
- ‚úÖ Updated to reference PRD and checklist files directly
- ‚úÖ Made prompt more reusable across different parent tasks
- ‚úÖ Committed to R branch (commit: 2633824)
- üìã Now works for any parent task by updating PARENT-VAR value

**Task 6.1 Completed** (2025-01-08):
- ‚úÖ Researched signature requirements for all 8 document types
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for signature blocks in `src/types/index.ts`
  - SignatureBlock, InitialBlock, WitnessBlock, NotaryBlock interfaces
  - FieldDefinition interface for flexible field configuration
  - TemplateWithSignatures interface extending base Template
- ‚úÖ Created detailed documentation in `docs/templates/signature-block-schema.md`
  - Complete schema structure documentation
  - Placement system and marker syntax
  - Layout options (side-by-side, standalone)
  - Best practices and usage guidelines
- ‚úÖ Created three example schemas demonstrating different complexity levels:
  - `signature-schema-single.json` - Simple attorney signature
  - `signature-schema-side-by-side.json` - Assignor/assignee with notary
  - `signature-schema-complex.json` - Multi-party with witnesses and initials
- ‚úÖ All tests passing, no breaking changes

**Task 6.2 Completed** (2025-01-08):
- ‚úÖ Investigated Patent Assignment Agreement signature requirements
  - Analyzed generated document structure
  - Identified need for assignor/assignee signatures
  - Found assignment clause needs initial blocks
  - Noted notary requirement for USPTO recording
- ‚úÖ Updated `templates/core/patent-assignment-agreement.json`:
  - Added signatureBlocks array with assignor and assignee signatures
  - Configured side-by-side layout for signatures
  - Added initialBlocks for assignment acknowledgment
  - Added notaryBlocks for USPTO recording requirements
  - Updated signature section content to include placement markers
  - Updated assignment section to include initial block marker
- ‚úÖ All tests passing, template loads correctly
- üìù Note: Markers appear in template but not yet in generated output (OpenAI service integration is a separate task)

### Next Priority

**Task 6.3**: Trademark Application signature/initial blocks
- Need to investigate and implement signature blocks for trademark applications
- Similar approach to Task 6.2

## Key Implementation Details

### Signature Block Schema
The signature block schema (defined in Task 6.1) includes:
- **SignatureBlock**: Core structure with id, type, placement, layout, party, and optional notary/witness requirements
- **InitialBlock**: For page-by-page or section-specific initials
- **Placement System**: Location-based (e.g., "after-section-5") with text markers
- **Layout Options**: Standalone or side-by-side positioning
- **Field Definitions**: Flexible field configuration with required/optional flags

### Template Updates Progress
- ‚úÖ Patent Assignment Agreement (Task 6.2)
- ‚è≥ Trademark Application (Task 6.3)
- ‚è≥ Cease and Desist Letter (Task 6.4)
- ‚è≥ NDA IP Specific (Task 6.5)
- ‚è≥ Office Action Response (Task 6.6)
- ‚è≥ Patent License Agreement (Task 6.7)
- ‚è≥ Provisional Patent Application (Task 6.8)
- ‚è≥ Technology Transfer Agreement (Task 6.9)

## Testing Status

All tests passing:
- ‚úÖ Template service tests
- ‚úÖ Full test suite (269 tests)
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes introduced

## Important Notes

1. **Marker Integration**: The signature block markers are defined in templates but not yet appearing in generated documents. This requires OpenAI service updates (likely in a future task).

2. **Multiple Assignors**: Patent Assignment template supports multiple assignors (common for founder assignments).

3. **Notary Requirements**: Added notary block support for documents requiring official recording (USPTO, etc.).

4. **Test-Driven Approach**: Each template update includes thorough testing to ensure no regressions.

## Git Status

- Current branch: R
- All changes committed
- Ready for next task

## Environment

- Docker development environment active
- Node.js 20 Alpine with TypeScript
- All dependencies installed and working

## Next Steps

1. Continue with Task 6.3: Trademark Application signature/initial blocks
2. Follow same pattern: investigate ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test
3. Update checklist after each subtask
4. Run full test suite after each template update
