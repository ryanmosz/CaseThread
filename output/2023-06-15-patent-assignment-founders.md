**CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGED**

**MEMORANDUM**

TO: David Park, CEO; Dr. Lisa Wang, CTO  
FROM: Sarah Chen, Partner  
DATE: June 15, 2023  
RE: Patent Assignment Agreement - Founders' IP Assignment  
MATTER NO.: TFS-2023-PAT01

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This memorandum accompanies the Patent Assignment Agreement securing TechFlow Solutions' ownership of all intellectual property created by the three co-founders. This assignment is critical for the upcoming Series B funding round, as investors have identified the lack of formal IP assignments as a material issue during preliminary due diligence.

### Key Points:
1. Three-party assignment from all founders
2. Covers past, present, and future inventions
3. Addresses deficiencies in original employment agreements
4. Includes cooperation obligations for patent prosecution
5. Consideration structured to satisfy legal requirements

## II. BACKGROUND AND URGENCY

### A. Discovery of Assignment Gap
During Series B preparation, Wilson Sonsini's due diligence revealed:
- Employment agreements dated 2019 contain only "agreement to assign" language
- No present assignment of inventions executed
- Provisional patent application lists three inventors but no assignment recorded
- Potential cloud on title for core technology

### B. Affected Technology
The assignment covers all TechFlow IP, specifically including:
1. **Predictive Cache Optimization System** (Provisional App. No. 63/234,567)
2. **LSTM Neural Network Architecture** for access pattern analysis
3. **Dynamic Cache Rebalancing Algorithms**
4. **Modified Raft Consensus Protocol** implementations
5. All related source code, documentation, and know-how

## III. PARTIES AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

### A. David Park (CEO & Co-Founder)
- **Inventive Contributions**: System architecture, business method claims
- **Employment Status**: Full-time CEO since incorporation
- **Equity Position**: 35% (subject to vesting)
- **Prior IP**: None conflicting identified

### B. Dr. Lisa Wang (CTO & Co-Founder)  
- **Inventive Contributions**: Core LSTM algorithms, technical implementation
- **Employment Status**: Full-time CTO since incorporation
- **Equity Position**: 35% (subject to vesting)
- **Prior IP**: PhD research excluded (pre-2019)

### C. Kevin Zhang (Principal Engineer)
- **Inventive Contributions**: Consensus protocol modifications, performance optimizations
- **Employment Status**: Full-time employee, early hire (Employee #3)
- **Equity Position**: 5% (subject to vesting)
- **Prior IP**: Open source contributions excluded

## IV. KEY TERMS OF ASSIGNMENT

### A. Scope of Assignment

1. **All Inventions**: Past, present, and future relating to TechFlow's business
2. **Provisional Patent**: Application No. 63/234,567 and all related rights
3. **Future Patents**: Any applications claiming priority to the provisional
4. **Trade Secrets**: All confidential algorithms and implementations
5. **Copyrights**: In source code and technical documentation
6. **Moral Rights**: To the extent permitted by law

### B. Consideration Structure

To ensure enforceability:
1. **Monetary**: $1,000 per assignor (paid immediately)
2. **Continued Employment**: Valuable consideration
3. **Equity Vesting**: Acceleration provisions tied to cooperation
4. **Mutual Benefit**: All founders benefit from clear IP ownership

### C. Representations and Warranties

Each founder represents:
1. No prior assignments of the technology
2. No third-party rights or encumbrances
3. Authority to make the assignment
4. No use of prior employer's confidential information
5. No government funding creating march-in rights

### D. Ongoing Obligations

1. **Cooperation in Patent Prosecution**:
   - Execute formal assignment documents
   - Provide technical information as needed
   - Review and sign declarations
   - Appear for depositions if required

2. **Disclosure Obligations**:
   - Promptly disclose new inventions
   - Maintain invention disclosure records
   - Identify potential prior art

3. **Confidentiality**:
   - Maintain trade secret status
   - Limit disclosure to authorized parties

## V. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### A. Past Invention Issues

The agreement specifically addresses:
1. **Retroactive Assignment**: Covers inventions from company formation
2. **Provisional Patent**: Formal assignment to be recorded with USPTO
3. **Source Code**: All commits to company repositories assigned
4. **Documentation**: All technical documents created assigned

### B. Open Source Complications

Kevin Zhang's history requires special handling:
1. **Carve-out**: Prior open source contributions excluded
2. **Identification**: Schedule A lists specific excluded projects
3. **New Contributions**: Company approval required for future OSS work
4. **License Compliance**: Representations regarding no GPL contamination

### C. Equity Considerations

Assignment linked to equity:
1. **Vesting Acceleration**: 6-month acceleration for execution
2. **Clawback Protection**: Assignment survives termination
3. **Tax Treatment**: 83(b) elections recommended
4. **Board Approval**: Required for equity modifications

## VI. SERIES B IMPLICATIONS

### A. Investor Requirements
Lead investor (Andreessen Horowitz) requires:
1. Clean IP ownership documentation
2. Recorded assignments with USPTO
3. Inventor cooperation agreements
4. No outstanding IP claims

### B. Valuation Impact
Clear IP ownership affects:
1. **Technology Value**: Core asset of company
2. **Risk Discount**: Reduced without IP uncertainty
3. **Competitive Position**: Defensible patent portfolio
4. **Exit Options**: Clean IP critical for acquisition

## VII. EXECUTION STRATEGY

### A. Signing Process
1. **Board Resolution**: Approve assignments and equity modifications
2. **Individual Meetings**: Explain terms to each founder
3. **Simultaneous Execution**: All three sign together
4. **Notarization**: Recommended for each signature
5. **USPTO Recording**: File within 5 days

### B. Related Documents

1. Updated employment agreements
2. Confidentiality agreement amendments
3. Stock option documentation updates
4. Board consent resolutions

## VIII. RISK MITIGATION

### A. Potential Challenges

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Founder refuses to sign | Equity vesting leverage, board pressure |
| Claims of additional consideration | Document $1,000 payment clearly |
| Future invention disputes | Detailed description of assigned technology |
| Prior employer claims | Representations and indemnification |

### B. Fallback Positions
If complete assignment cannot be obtained:
1. **Partial Assignment**: Prioritize provisional patent rights
2. **License Alternative**: Exclusive license as backup
3. **Escrow Arrangement**: Tie to equity vesting milestones
4. **Legal Action**: Specific performance as last resort

## IX. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Execute Immediately**: Before Series B term sheet negotiations
2. **Record with USPTO**: Establish public notice of ownership
3. **Update Employment Agreements**: Include present assignment language
4. **Implement IP Procedures**: Regular invention disclosure process
5. **Consider IP Insurance**: Errors and omissions coverage

## X. CONCLUSION

The Patent Assignment Agreement resolves a critical gap in TechFlow's IP portfolio. While the lack of initial assignment creates complexity, the three-party agreement provides a comprehensive solution. The consideration structure and ongoing obligations ensure both legal enforceability and practical cooperation.

Time is of the essence given the Series B timeline. I recommend scheduling the signing for next week, allowing time for individual discussions with each founder while maintaining momentum toward funding.
