Re: Trademark Infringement - Cease and Desist Demand

Dear Josh Shipley:

We are writing to bring to your attention a matter of mutual concern regarding intellectual property rights.

Ryan M owns valuable intellectual property rights in Gummi Bear Designs used for candy packaging.

It has come to our attention that you are stealing Gummi Bear designs from a high-school notebook and incorporating them into your candy packaging. Evidence of this infringement is attached as Exhibit A.

Your use of a confusingly similar mark constitutes trademark infringement under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1114 and unfair competition under 15 U.S.C. ยง 1125(a). This creates a likelihood of confusion among consumers.

Therefore, we demand that you:

1. CONTACT US to discuss a possible licensing arrangement if you wish to continue using our intellectual property;  
2. CONFIRM IN WRITING within 14 days that you have complied with these demands.

We hope to resolve this matter amicably and avoid the need for legal action. However, if necessary, we are prepared to protect our intellectual property rights through appropriate legal channels.

We trust that this matter can be resolved quickly and amicably. Please contact us at your earliest convenience to discuss this matter.

You must respond within 14 days of the date of this letter.

Sincerely,

[SIGNATURE_BLOCK:attorney-signature]

Attorney for Ryan M
